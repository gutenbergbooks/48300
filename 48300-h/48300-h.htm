<h2 id="IMPROVED_CALORIC_ENGINE">IMPROVED CALORIC ENGINE.</h2>

<p>Caloric engines have long been used by the Trinity
Board to provide power for working siren fog signals
in connection with their lighthouses in England. They
have generally been in the past of the horizontal type,
but lately a new pattern, which we illustrate from
<i>Engineering</i>, has been brought out; and as the entire
work of the motor consists in driving air-compressing
pumps, this form of engine should give very good
results. At one end of a beam stands the retort or
furnace with the motor cylinder, and at the other end
stand three pumps. One of these forces air into the
furnace, a second supplies the receiver of the fog signal,
while the third, which is smaller than the second, performs
the same office, when it is desired to raise the
pressure to a point too high for the larger pump to accomplish.
As fogs come on very suddenly, and give so
little warning that it is often impossible to get the engine
into action before the vision is entirely obscured,
it is customary to keep a store of air in the receiver at
two or three times the usual working pressure, and it
is from the accumulation of this pressure that the
smaller pump is provided.</p>

<p>The furnace is a closed receiver, and is fed with coke.
Air is pumped into it at a pressure of about 30 lb. to
the square inch, part being delivered below the fuel
and part above. That part which goes below rises
through the incandescent coke, and appears at the
surface as carbonic oxide. Here it meets the upper air
supply and burns with a fierce bright flame, producing
very hot gases, which are admitted to the cylinder and
there expand, driving the piston before them. From
experiments made by Mr. C. Ingrey with engines of
this kind, it appears that they consume from 2¼ lb. to
2½ lb. of coke per brake horse power per hour, and
thus provide power very economically.</p>

<p>The engine is regulated by a governor, which varies
the proportion of air admitted above and below the
fuel, and thus alters the temperature of the gases admitted
to the cylinder. The distributing valves are of
the conical type, worked by tappets, and the fall is
regulated by an air cushion.</p>

<p>These engines, for there are a pair, have been constructed
by the Pulsometer Engineering Company,
Limited, London, for the Northern Lights Commissioners,
and will be erected on a lightship, probably at
the North Carr. Each engine is nominally of six horse
power, but actually gives ten horse power. The motor
cylinder is 24 in. in diameter, the air pump 18 in., and
the compressing pumps 9 in. and 5 in. respectively, all
with a stroke of 18 in.</p>

<h2 id="Naval_Architecture_During_the_Last_Half_Century">Naval Architecture During the Last Half Century.</h2>

<p>The annual lecture under the auspices of the
Greenock Philosophical Society, to commemorate the
birth of James Watt, was delivered in the Watt Lecture
Hall, Greenock, on January 14, by Mr. Robert
Duncan, shipbuilder, Port Glasgow. The title of Mr.
Duncan's paper was "Evolution in Naval Architecture
during the Reign of Queen Victoria." After referring
to the early history of marine engineering, and
to the intimate connection of Greenock and the Clyde
with its initial stages, Mr. Duncan went on to say
that up to the date of her Majesty's accession in 1837,
no systematic attempt at ocean navigation by steam
had been made. In 1812 steamship building began,
but it was not till 1838 that the first Atlantic steam
communication began. The Sirius and the Great
Western made the voyage to and from New York at
the same time, in the middle of that year, in fourteen
and seventeen days respectively, under steam all the
way. Mr. Duncan then traced rapidly the evolution
of the iron ship, through the various modifications of
design and proportion, and the simultaneous and consequent
evolution of crafts to adapt themselves to the
rapidly changing conditions. Mr. Duncan also described
the influence upon the forms of ships of maritime
law and of Lloyd's rules&mdash;evolution in size from
the short square boxes of the early periods to the
long narrow vessels of to-day; the Enterprise, for example,
the first steamer to make the voyage to India
by the Cape of Good Hope, being only 122 feet long,
while now the cargo carrying steamer is over 400
feet long, and the express passenger ocean steamer over
500 feet. Mr. Duncan considers it possible that, ere
her Majesty's reign closes, the Flying Scotchman of
the sea will reach a length of 800 feet, and a speed
of twenty-five to thirty miles an hour. The evolution
of the man-of-war was next described, an interesting
sketch given of the science of naval architecture,
and a bibliography of the subject.</p>

<h2 id="A_Three_Cylinder_Locomotive">A Three Cylinder Locomotive.</h2>

<p>The Dunmore Iron and Steel Company, at Dunmore,
Pa., has a small locomotive in use switching in its
yards which is of a novel pattern. It is thus described
by the superintendent of the works: "This little engine
has three 8 X 12 in. steam cylinders, four 33 in.
driving wheels, two outside connecting and parallel
rods, and one inside connecting rod. No balancing is
needed in driving wheels. The engine has six exhausts
to a revolution, and the effect on the fire is good. It is
claimed that by setting the cranks at an angle of 120
degrees the slip is reduced to a minimum. This engine
makes 30 miles an hour on a 40 ft. grade easily, with a
light load, and is considered a good machine by those
who have run her. Its weight is about 12 tons."

<h2 id="NEW_AMENDMENT_OF_THE_DESIGN_PATENT_LAW">NEW AMENDMENT OF THE DESIGN PATENT LAW.</h2>

<p>An amendment of the patent law relating to design
patents has lately passed both houses of Congress and
received the approval of the President. The object of
the amendment is to correct a defect in the law, which
prevented the patentee from collecting damages in
cases of infringement.</p>

<p>Under the old law, the Supreme Court held that in
the case, for example, of a carpet manufacturer who
complained of an infringement of his design or pattern
of carpet, the complainant must clearly prove what
portion of the damage, or what portion of the profit
made by the infringer, was due to the use of the patented
design. It was practically impossible to make this
showing. Hence the infringer could imitate the patented
design without liability, and the law was a nullity.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the new law, the infringer is
obliged to pay the sum of $250 in any event; and if his
profits are more than that sum, he is compelled, in addition,
to pay all excess of profits above $250 to
the patentee. It is believed that the penalty of $250,
irrespective of profits, will put a stop to the wholesale
system of infringement heretofore carried on by unscrupulous
persons.</p>

<p>The following is the text of the new law:</p>

<p>An act to amend the law relating to patents, trade
marks, and copyright.</p>

<p><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>,
That hereafter, during the term of letters
patent for a design, it shall be unlawful for any person
other than the owner of said letters patent, without
the license of such owner, to apply the design secured
by such letters patent, or any colorable imitation
thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose
of sale, or to sell or expose for sale any article of manufacture
to which such design or colorable imitation
shall, without the license of the owner, have been applied,
knowing that the same has been so applied.
Any person violating the provisions, or either of them,
of this section shall be liable in the amount of two
hundred and fifty dollars; and in case the total profit
made by him from the manufacture or sale, as aforesaid,
of the article or articles to which the design, or
colorable imitation thereof, has been applied, exceeds
the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, he shall be
further liable for the excess of such profit over and
above the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars; and
the full amount of such liability may be recovered
by the owner of the letters patent, to his own use, in
any circuit court of the United States having jurisdiction
of the parties, either by action at law or upon
a bill in equity for an injunction to restrain such
infringement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec</span>. 2. That nothing in this act contained shall
prevent, lessen, impeach, or avoid any remedy at law
or in equity which any owner of letters patent for a
design, aggrieved by the infringement of the same,
might have had if this act had not been passed; but
such owner shall not twice recover the profit made
from the infringement.</p>

<p>Approved, February 4, 1887.</p>

<h2 id="ARE_STEEL_GUNS_REALLY_SUPERIOR">ARE STEEL GUNS REALLY SUPERIOR?</h2>

<p>Admiral Porter said recently that there was little
hope of building fast war ships as long as the Bureau
of Steam Engineering designed the engines, for that,
such was the influence of interested persons, it was
not free to choose the best devices. Whoever is familiar
with the workings of the Ordnance Bureau will admit
that this, too, is similarly controlled. Long ago it pronounced
in favor of steel guns, and like a judge who
records his decision and then asks to hear the evidence,
this bureau has been listening unmoved to the most
convincing testimony regarding the relative efficiency
of cast iron guns.</p>

<p>The importance of this question of steel <i>vs</i>. cast iron
guns will be appreciated when it is explained that it
would take at least five years after the passage of an
appropriation before the first steel gun could be turned
out, while only a twelvemonth would be required to establish
a cast iron gun plant.</p>

<p>It has never been the custom among American mechanicians
to blindly follow the lead of others, but
rather to work untrammeled by traditions; to carefully
note what has already been done, and to strike out
anew in whatever direction gives the most promise.
Experienced gun makers and artillerists have recently
admitted that the steel rifle has not fulfilled the promises
made for it. The Krupp guns, of which we hear
so much, have never yet been subjected to such high
pressures as have been applied to cast iron guns, and
experience has shown it would not be safe to put them
through such tests. Indeed, the cast-iron smooth bore
guns which have been converted into rifles by the insertion
of wrought iron rifled cylinders have been
fired under a pressure fully three times as great as it
has been thought advisable to subject steel guns of
the same caliber to. An authority says: "Cast iron
guns have often been fired hundreds of rounds
under pressure of nearly seventeen tons to the
square inch of bore, yet there has never been a
failure, nor a sign of one. The United States has now
a 12½ in. cast iron rifle constructed on the same plan
as the 8 in. converted rifle. This gun was made ten
years ago, as an experiment. It has been fired with
charges as high as two hundred pounds of hexagonal
or quick powder (as compared with powder now considered
suitable), and is still serviceable. The United
States has another experimental 12 in. rifle, entirely of
cast iron. It has been fired more than a hundred
rounds with high power charges (265 pounds powder,
800 pound shot), and is still serviceable."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the experiments with these guns
ceased at the very time when there was the most
reason for continuing them, to wit, while they were
giving evidence of their ability to stand a long series
of continuous rounds. The mode of testing a high
pressure gun, upon which all authorities agree,
is to fire it, round after round, until it bursts
or shows weakness. There is authority for the
statement that there is not a 12 inch steel gun
in Europe which has been fired two hundred
rounds, and yet, just as soon as these cast iron
guns gave promise of withstanding successfully such
a test, a peremptory order came from the Ordnance
Bureau to cease firing and stop further experiment.</p>

<p>The failure of steel guns in Europe is frequent,
though there is good reason for the belief that we
only hear of a tithe of them, the balance being kept
secret. Only the other day a big steel gun exploded
at the muzzle, on the French trial grounds, and news
comes that both in the war ships Collingwood and Ajax
a number of steel guns have been condemned.</p>

<p>Because of these facts it is not at all surprising that
the majority in the House of Representatives, though
willing to appropriate money for guns, are averse to
having the outlay controlled by the Ordnance Bureau,
which is wedded to the steel gun theory and others
not much better sustained.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="THE_COCAINE_HABIT">THE COCAINE HABIT.</h2>

<p>A number of cases of confirmed cocaine habit have
recently been reported. While some of them lack confirmation,
it is certain that several physical and mental
wrecks have been caused by the excessive use of this
alkaloid. The South American Indians, long famous
as coca eaters, seem as a rule not to succumb to its
effects. They use the dried leaf, which they chew,
previously introducing a small amount of alkali, to set
the cocaine free. In civilized countries the alkaloid as
a chloride is usually employed, and is administered by
hypodermic injection.</p>

<p>The practice of using it habitually in excess is hitherto
reported as almost confined to physicians. Its
effects upon its victims are very sad. The brain becomes
permanently or for a period affected, a species
of lunacy being produced. Just as in the case of opium
eaters, the moral nature is undermined. One doctor was
reported, so recently as to be within the memory of our
readers, as having turned on the gas in a drug store
where the alkaloid was refused him, with the design of
asphyxiating the clerk, in which attempt he nearly
succeeded. Another doctor, within a space of some
sixteen months, has gone insane from the cocaine habit
and has been removed to an asylum, leaving his wife
also ill from the effects of the same drug, with which he
had experimented on her.</p>

<p>If the cases continue to multiply, there may be room
for questioning the utility to man of the discovery of
this anæsthetic. It is doubtful if all the services in
local anæsthesia rendered by it can compensate for the
ill it has already done.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="Pyrofuxin_a_New_Tanning_Substance_from_Coal">Pyrofuxin&mdash;a New Tanning Substance from Coal.</h2>

<p>A new extract of coal is being introduced in Germany
for industrial purposes, especially for tanning
leather and disinfection generally, to which the name
"pyrofuxin" is given by the discoverer, Professor
Paulus Reinsch, of Erlangen, Bavaria. Unlike the
generality of such compounds, this new material is not a
derivative of coal tar, or of any of the distillates of coal,
but is obtained directly from coal itself. Pit or bituminous
coal contains most of it, and is prepared for
treatment by being broken into nuts. The crude pyrofuxin
is extracted by repeated boilings in a solution of
caustic soda. The pyrofuxin enters into solution, and
is allowed to stand for a time. It is then poured off,
and a carbonic acid gas is passed through it. The resultant
liquor has a specific gravity of 1.025 to 1.030,
and holds from 10 to 15 grammes of pyrofuxin to the
liter. In its purified form the compound is a fine, non-triturable
substance, without taste or smell, non-poisonous,
and in appearance like catechu. Some Russian
coals contain 18 per cent of pyrofuxin. After the extraction
of this material the coal remains combustible.
It is described as being one of the most powerful and
effective antiseptics known to science. On this account
it is expected to be most valuable for tanning, as being
twenty-eight times quicker in action than bark, and
producing a better result at decreased cost.</p>

<p>It will be soon enough to give credence to this alleged
leather tanning agent when specimens of good leather
are produced.

<h2 id="Castners_New_Method_for_Producing_Sodium">Castner's New Method for Producing Sodium.</h2>

<p>This new method, heretofore mentioned by us, is
now being successfully worked in London, and is thus
described in <i>Engineering</i>:</p>

<p>Up to the present this novel method of manufacture
has been kept rather secret, but now, owing to the success
achieved by a plant erected and worked on a commercial
scale, we are enabled, through the courtesy of
Mr. H. Y. Castner, to lay before our readers an outline
sketch of the method of operation which is followed,
and which we have seen carried out with success at his
works, 65 Belvidere Road, Lambeth. Few persons outside
of the chemical profession are aware of the commercial
existence of the metal sodium or of its uses, and
even among those following that profession but little
is known, except that it is used in the manufacture of
aluminum, and is very expensive. Much has lately
been published in various scientific journals throughout
the world upon the subject of alleged new processes,
whereby that highly interesting metal&mdash;aluminum&mdash;might
be cheaply produced without sodium,
and thus be made to take in the commercial world a
place to which its varied valuable properties entitle it.
So far nothing has resulted from these numerous so-called
discoveries, and at the present time the only
process in use whereby aluminum can be produced is
that devised by and due to Deville's ingenuity.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This
process has been called the sodium process, apparently
to distinguish it from others, but seeing that it is the
only process which has ever proved practical, it is
somewhat of a mystery why it needed to be so distinguished.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Walter Weldon, in a paper read before
the Society of Chemical Industry a few years ago,
clearly resolved the great question of cheaply producing
aluminum, and showed by argument that this end
was only to be gained in either of the two following
directions, namely, first, by the production of cheap
sodium and the employment of Deville's process, and
second, by the discovery of a substitute for sodium,
which has hitherto given to aluminum its excessive
cost in production. After twenty-five years of research
by some of the best scientists of the present age, no
substance has been found that will replace sodium, and
although every known substance has, at various times,
been proposed, none has been successful. So discouraging
has been the research, that those familiar
with the subject have almost abandoned hope of ever
seeing aluminum cheaply manufactured by chemical
processes, believing also that Weldon's first proposition
was an impossibility.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this article to enter into
a lengthy discussion of Mr. Castner' process of producing
sodium, as Mr. James Mactear, F.C.S., is about to
prepare a scientific paper on the subject, to be read on
March 7 before the Society of Chemical Industry. We
shall content ourselves by presenting to our readers a
short practical description of the process and its results.</p>

<p>Before doing so it will, however, be advantageous to
give a short account of the method by which sodium
has hitherto been separated from its compounds, in
order that a clearer conception of the features in which
the new process differs from the old one may be obtained.
At high temperatures carbon has the property
of separating sodium from its oxygen compounds,
carbon uniting with the oxygen to form carbonic oxide,
the sodium being thereby liberated. In the
usual process this reaction is brought about by mixing
carbonate of soda, lime, and carbon in small wrought
iron cylinders, and exposing them to an intense heat,
when a part of the sodium comes off as vapor. The
lime is added to prevent fusion, for were the mass to
melt, the carbon would float on the top, and could no
longer attack the soda. The new process differs from
the old principally in working with a fused mass of
soda compound, this operation having been rendered
feasible by the most ingenious device of weighting
every particle of carbon with iron, so that the two
chemicals&mdash;soda and carbon&mdash;are kept in perfect admixture,
and are continually presenting fresh surfaces
to each other as the liquid circulates in the crucible
under the action of the heat. By this simple but beautiful
plan of weighting the carbon, it is rendered possible
to employ a soda compound which is decomposed
at a much lower temperature than that hitherto used,
and to carry on the process in large and durable vessels,
instead of in small cylinders, which have a very
short life. Having thus given a short account of the
chemical process, we will describe the commercial
method of manufacture.</p>

<p>The operations are carried on in large cast steel crucibles,
and the charges consist of caustic soda and a
finely ground artificial compound of carbon and iron,
which is the reducing agent. This compound is made
by coking a mixture of fine iron and pitch. The crucibles
containing these materials are first heated in a
small furnace at a low temperature, the object being to
expel the hydrogen from the caustic alkali and bring
about quiet fusion. The crucibles are then removed
from this furnace, by means of a little truck, and placed
upon a movable platform, which is operated by hydraulic
power. They are then by this means raised
into the large furnace, where the crucible covers are
fixed stationary. The edges of the crucible and cover
coming together form a tight joint, and from this cover
projects a small tube to the outside of the furnace into
a narrow rectangular box, known as the condenser.
The reduction of the sodium commences soon after the
crucible containing the charge is in its place, the vapors
and gases passing from the fused mixture through the
exit pipe from the cover into the condenser, where the
metallic vapors are condensed to metal, while the uncondensed
gases escape by a small outlet tube. After
the charge is exhausted, the crucible is lowered, and
one containing a fresh charge raised in its place; in
this manner the process might almost be called continuous.</p>

<p>The actual temperature used in this process to bring
about reduction, as measured by experts, has been
found to be 850° Cent. By the older method the temperature
necessary is about 1,400° Cent. This is practically
the great point of economy in this process, as
the high price of sodium has hitherto been owing to
the excessive heat used in the older process and the
consequent destruction of the wrought iron vessels.
Sodium at present costs about four shillings per pound
to produce, while the materials necessary for this quantity,
were nothing wasted, would hardly cost four
pence. The difference between these two figures represents
the wear and tear to the furnace, the destruction
of the wrought iron cylinders, the loss and waste
of materials, the excessive labor and care necessary to
employ in manufacturing, and fuel. Approximately,
the cost of these items in producing one pound of
sodium by the older process is as follows:</p>

<p>Two shillings is due to the destruction of wrought
iron, etc.</p>

<p>One shilling is due to the loss and waste of materials,
of which three times the theoretical quantity must be
employed.</p>

<p>Eightpence is due to the labor.</p>

<p>Fourpence is due to the fuel.</p>

<p>Mr. Castner seems justified in his claim to produce
sodium at a shilling per pound in large quantities. The
steel crucibles which have now been in use some time
show but little wear, and indicate indefinite use in
future, thus reducing the first item of cost in the older
process to a fraction. There is hardly any appreciable
loss or waste of materials, and from four pennyworth
of caustic soda is ultimately obtained one pound of
sodium. The labor is a very small item of expense, and
the fuel consumed is less than one-third that used in
the older process.</p>

<p>Seventy-five tons of fuel are required by the older
method in producing one ton of sodium. From actual
results a like amount of fuel will produce over three
tons of sodium by Mr. Castner's process. The results
from this new process are not obtained by calculations
on paper, as the inventor has shown from actual working
that his claims are well founded. The process is no
longer an experimental one, the furnace now erected
having a capacity of 120 pounds of sodium per day,
which is probably more than is produced at any works
now in existence. The production of sodium at one
shilling a pound by this process may be considered an
accomplished fact, which ultimately means cheapened
aluminum and a solution of the problem that has so
long engaged the attention of chemists and metallurgists.</p>

<h2 id="Preventive_Medicine">Preventive Medicine.</h2>

<p>Dr. C. R. Illingworth thus writes in the <i>Med. Press:</i></p>

<p>One of our great aims as physicians is to prevent
disease; another is to cut short its course when developed.
Our power in these directions finds full
scope among that class of disorders now generally
recognized as depending upon the reception, growth,
and development in the tissues of micro-organic life
in one shape or another. By the continual suppression
of the growth and development of these forms of cell
life, we may, indeed, hope at length to erase the names
of the diseases they cause from the category of those
"ills that flesh is heir to." The diseases I refer to are
scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough,
rheumatic fever, chicken-pox, small-pox, syphilis, hydrophobia,
yellow fever, <i>et hoc genus omne.</i></p>

<p>The germicide remedy I have found to answer as a
specific and prophylactic in such diseases is the biniodide
of mercury given in solution of potassic iodide.
In all cases of scarlatina or measles occurring in one
member of a family, I put the rest upon preventive
medicine. Thus, for children I prescribe as follows:
Bichloride of mercury solution, ℥ iss; iodide of potassium,
ʒ j; ammonio-citrate of iron, ʒ j; sirup, ℥ iss;
water to eight ounces. One or two teaspoonfuls to be
given three times a day.</p>

<h2 id="The_Peace_Army_of_the_United_States">The Peace Army of the United States.</h2>

<p>The following figures are believed to be approximately
accurate, and most interesting and instructive
they are:</p>

<table summary=" ">
  <tr>
    <td>French army, peace footing.</td>
    <td class="tdr">523,283</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>German army, peace footing.</td>
    <td class="tdr">445,417</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>United States army of pensioners, peace footing.</td>
    <td class="tdr">400,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>One of the great evils of a huge standing army is the
cost of its support&mdash;a constant drain upon the national
resources.</p>

<p>It does not seem that in this respect we have so very
much the advantage of France or Germany, loaded
down as those nations are with military burdens.</p>

<p>The great difference is that, while all or nearly all of
the French and German soldiers, supported at the
national expense, are available in case of a national
emergency, few or none of ours are.</p>

<p>Is this enormous burden a just debt?</p>

<p>The question is best answered by another question.
Is it not fair to assume that in 1877, twelve years after
the end of the civil war, about all the equitable claims
for pensions on account of that war had been put in
and allowed?</p>

<p>Yet since 1877, the number of pensioners on our rolls
has almost doubled; and the annual cost of maintaining
them has nearly trebled.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Sun.</i></p>

<h2 id="A_Solid_Life_Insurance_Company">A Solid Life Insurance Company.</h2>

<p>The figures of the last annual report of the New York
Life Insurance Company, just issued, present a record
of almost unexampled success in the conduct of the
business of that old and strong company for the past
year. Its income for the year was $19,230,408, it paid
policy holders $7,627,230, and it has cash assets amounting
to $75,421,453. It goes without the saying that this
great company does its insurance business on strictly
business principles. It recognizes the policy holder's
right to paid-up insurance in case of a discontinuance
of payment of premiums, and its policies are notably
free from restrictions as to occupation, residence, and
travel. The company issues a great variety of policies,
thus adapting its contracts to the wants of almost every
one having present means from which a small percentage
can be spared for the benefit of themselves or those
dependent upon them at a future date.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Giles de la Tourette</span> has recently published
a monograph upon normal locomotion and the variations
in the gait caused by diseases of the nervous
system. He found, from a comparison of a large number
of cases, that the average length of pace is, for
men, 25 inches; for women, 20 inches. The step with
the right foot is somewhat longer than that with the
left. The feet are separated laterally in walking about
4½ inches in men and about 5 inches in women.

<h2 id="EMERY_WHEELS_FOR_GUMMING_SAWS">EMERY WHEELS FOR GUMMING SAWS.</h2>

<p>In the illustration herewith, the operation of gumming
saws with an emery wheel is vividly represented,
the frame affording sufficient support for the side of
the saw where the teeth are being ground, and the
arrangement being a simple one, readily made at any
work bench or machine where a shaft is run upon
which an emery wheel can be placed. The operation
itself involves only the simplest mechanical knowledge
and but a rudimentary experience in the handling of
tools, yet the desirability of this method of sharpening
saws is largely dependent upon the kind of emery
wheel used and the rate of speed at which it is run.</p>

<div id="p130a" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p130a.jpg"

<p class="caption">EMERY VULCANITE SAW GUMMER.</p>
</div>

<p>The vulcanite emery wheels made by the New York
Belting and Packing Company have especial advantages
for this kind of work. They are strong and safe
at the highest speed at which it is desirable to run
them, the company recommending that they never be
run at a less rate than 6,000 feet per minute circumferential
speed, and from that up to 8,000 and 10,000 feet
per minute, although the lowest named speed is rather
above the ordinary limit of many other kinds of emery
wheels, and attempts to run other wheels at or beyond
this limit have frequently resulted in serious accidents,
from the breaking of the wheels. The higher rate of
speed, which not only cuts faster, but, in the case of
the vulcanite emery wheel, prolongs the life of the
wheel, is concededly safe with the vulcanite wheel.
Thus run, it is not likely to wear out of true, the
operator does not have to bear on so hard, and the
wheel retains its shape much better than when run at
a slow speed. The nature of the wear of the working
surface in the vulcanite wheel is claimed to be essentially
different from that in wheels where the emery is
fixed in its place by other methods, the rubber affording
an elastic foundation or cushion, from which the
particles of emery slightly protrude. This not only
insures more efficient work from the cutting edges of
the emery, as they become changed by use, but allows
of more access of air to the work, thus
tending to prevent casehardening of
the edges of the metal being ground.</p>

<p>In addition to wheels with bevel
shaped grinding surfaces, as represented
in the engraving, the company
also make wheels with round grinding
surfaces, and this kind is always considered
best for large saws.</p>

<p>In technical terms this is a living
species of cladodont shark, named by
Mr. Garman <i>Chlamydoselachus anguineus.</i></p>

<p>The specimen here figured was found
in a miscellaneous collection of fishes,
etc., in alcohol, furnished the Museum
of Comparative Zoology by Professor
H. A. Ward, who purchased them in
Japan. It was soon recognized as not
only belonging to a new family, but
one closely allied to certain forms supposed
to have become extinct in the
Carboniferous time. This discovery
displaces <i>Ceratodus</i> from the position
of the oldest living type of the vertebrata.</p>

<p>The term Chlamydoselachus is applied
on account of the curious frill-like
mantle that surmounts the first
gill cover. The term is made up of
two Greek words implying mantle and
shark. Six gill openings, and certain
structure of the brain, remove this
form from the present known sharks.
Its affinity to some of the earliest
known sharks, those of the middle
Devonian, render it of great interest
and importance to science. The family
characters which this form represents,
under the term <i>Chlamydoselachidæ</i>,
are: Body elongate, with a depressed head.
The eyes are lateral, with no nictitating membrane.
The nasal cavity is separate from that of the mouth.
The mouth is situated anteriorly, like that of some
fishes. The teeth have broad, backward extended
bases and slender cusps. The spiracles are present.
One dorsal fin, spineless, is
present. There is also an anal
fin, and a caudal with no pit
at its root. The first gill cover
is free across the isthmus.
The intestine has a spiral
valve.</p>

<p>The generic characters are:
Six gill openings, opercular
flap, first gill cover, broad.
Teeth similar in both jaws;
each with three slender, curved,
subconical cusps, separated
by a pair of rudimentary
denticles or a broad base.
There is no median upper
series of teeth in front, but
there is a series below, on the
symphysis. The mouth is
wide, and has no labial folds
at the angles. The pupil is
horizontally elongate; the fins are broad, the caudal
without a notch.</p>

<p>The total length of this shark is nearly five feet. Its
greatest width, across the ventrals, is seven inches.
Its resemblance to a snake is very striking. Its elongated
body, long, flattened head, anterior mouth, and
sinister expression of the eyes are quite suggestive of
the ophidians. There are fifty-one rows of teeth, and
six teeth in each row; the whole number at one time in
function is 306. The brain is very small.</p>

<p>The present state of icthyological science recognizes
eliminations that have been made from its main
body. Comprehensively, a fish is a cold-blooded vertebrate,
adapted for life in the water, breathing by
means of gills, having the limbs, if present, in the
form of fins, the smaller members being represented
by cartilaginous rays connected by membrane. One
or more fins are developed on the median line of the
body.</p>

<p>The lancelets, myzonts, myxinoids, hag fishes, lampreys,
sharks, and rays are recognized as differing
sufficiently from the true fishes to entitle them to
places of class distinction.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FRILLED SHARK&mdash;THE OLDEST LIVING TYPE OF VERTEBRATES.</p>
</div>

<p>The true fishes form one class; the elasmobranchs,
sharks, and rays, another class; the marsipobranchs,
myxinoid fishes, hag fishes, and lampreys, a class; and
the lancelets and cirrostomes, a class. It will be seen,
then, that technically there are four classes of fish-like
vertebrates, where but one&mdash;fishes&mdash;has heretofore been
recognized. The lancelets, as is well known, are the
lowest in the scale, their structure being extremely
simple. The skull in this class is undeveloped, the brain
not distinctly differentiated, nor is there any heart.</p>

<p>The term Leptocardii, which designates this class,
means thin heart, in reference to the simplicity of this
portion of the arterial system.</p>

<p>At first sight of the mouth of the frilled shark, which
is figured here, the teeth have a singular and wholly
unnatural appearance, appearing like indented, leaf-like
organs; but it is seen that there are three fangs,
serpent-like, on a base, and several rows of them give
the peculiar appearance, arranged as they are consecutively
from before inward.</p>

<p>The Port Jackson sharks, of the family <i>Heterodontidæ</i>,
have long been regarded as of great interest to
paleontologists, from their being closely related to
some extinct sharks. Under the term Cestracion (now
<i>Gyropleurodus</i>), these sharks are known to naturalists.
A species, <i>G. francisci</i>, is now found off the coast of
California.</p>

<p><i>Cestracion phillipi</i> is found in the Australian seas.
The term cestracion is from the Greek <i>kestra</i>, a
weapon. Many of the extinct species are known by
the preservation of this spine, which being of more
durable structure is preserved after all other traces of
the creature have passed away.</p>

</div>

<p>The mouth of the frilled shark, as seen in our engraving,
is peculiar appearing for a shark, as this important
part is usually situated far beneath. In this respect,
the anterior aspect of the mouth, there is resemblance
to that of the great rhinodon, the largest living fish,
measuring 70 feet in length. The general appearance
of this shark is, however, extremely different from that
of the frilled shark. The rhinodon is immensely
bulky, the head being quite as deep and wide as any
other portion. A very interesting structure, and one
little known, belonging to the latter is a set of whalebone-like
fringes along the gills, arranged
comb-like. These frills have
much the same functions of those in
the whalebone or right whales. The
food of the creature is mostly of sea
jellies and other soft pelagic animals,
which are strained into the throat by
means of this adaptation. The great
basking shark has this structure.
This shark has been taken off Block
Island measuring, according to authority,
nearly seventy feet. It is the <i>Cetorhinus</i>,
or bone shark, also so called.
Large as these creatures are, they are
harmless, most fortunately, their teeth
being very small. Their food being of
gelatinous animal matter, the masticating
apparatus is not required to
be of any considerable size or strength.
The more harmful sharks are of moderate
dimensions, in which the teeth are
very large. In the largest species of
"maneater" shark living, the teeth
are about two inches in length. Some
of the great carcharodon-like fossil
sharks have teeth measuring five inches
and a half in length. One in my
possession has that measurement.
Judging from the size of the shark,
which has a tooth two inches in length,
the extinct species here indicated must
have been much over one hundred feet
in length. Such enormous size can
more readily be accommodated in the
vast ocean than that of the great land
beasts on their appropriate element.
I am indebted to papers on this subject
by Mr. Garman, of Cambridge,
Mass., for material of this account.</p>

<h2 id="COMBINED_BENCH_AND_IRONING_BOARD">COMBINED BENCH AND IRONING BOARD.</h2>

<p>The bench is composed of side pieces, legs, end
pieces, and a central cross brace. At one end it is provided
with stationary top pieces having curved inner
edges, as shown in the upper view, which are covered
with a thin strip of angle iron extending up flush with
the top and bent to conform with the curved edge.
To the upper ends of the legs are hinged supports
adapted to extend upward to form continuations of the
legs, to engage with and hold an ironing board in a
horizontal position. A tongue formed upon the free
end of each support enters a socket box fitted in a
recess formed in the board, so that the hinged lids of
the boxes are flush with the bench surface of the
board. When the board is in position to be ironed
upon, the hinged lids rest against the sides of
the supports, an opening in the lids receiving pins
projecting from the sides of the supports. The lids
are held in this position by suitably arranged buttons.
By this means the ironing board is securely
fixed in its elevated position. The rigidity of each
support is promoted by another button attached to
its inner side, and which enters a slot in the top edge of
the side piece. To convert the ironing board into a
bench, the board is lifted up and the supports
closed down within the bench, as shown in the lower
view. The wraps used upon the board are then
placed neatly over the supports. The board itself is
then turned over and its narrow end slid under the
projection of the angle iron to a bearing upon the
upper edges of the bench frame. The board now
forms a smooth top for the bench. The under side of
the ironing board, when forming a seat, is recessed
near each side of its square end. Each recess is covered
by a metal plate having a diamond-shaped opening
to receive the elongated head of a bolt secured
to the inner face of the bench side pieces. The square
end of the board is thus held to the bench, the narrow
end being held by the angle irons.</p>

<p>By means of the simple attachment here shown, the
blind may be securely held in any desired position.
Secured to the lower cross bar is a metal plate, bent at
right angles to form flanges, the projecting one of
which is finely corrugated. The plate is held to the
bar by screws passing through the other flange. Across
the face of the outer flange is secured a spring retaining
strip, which bears against the corrugated face and
which carries a set screw. To the end of the slat bar
is secured a corrugated strip, which is passed between
the flange and its strip, the corrugated faces resting
against each other, as shown in the right hand view.</p>

<p>This device will hold the slats in any required position,
but when the slat bar is subjected to a positive
pull, the strip will slip upon the face of the flange,
against which it will be held by the action of the spring
strip. By means of the set screw, the parts may be so
locked together as to prevent the turning of the slats
from the outside.</p>

<p>This invention has been patented by Mrs. Lizzie T.
Gulick, of Corsicana, Texas.</p>

<h2 id="The_British_Armament_at_Victoria">The British Armament at Victoria.</h2>

<p>Some mistake appears to have been made in the
recent announcement that the British Government are
sending out a number of eighty ton guns for the coast
defense of Esquimault and Victoria. Twelve sixty-four
pounders have been sent out from England, not
for the armaments of the forts, but to be placed on
board the British ships of war belonging to the Pacific
squadron or to go into the naval reserves. Some time
ago the British Minister of War made application to
the Canadian Pacific Railway to know if they could
transport one or more eighty ton guns over their road.
An estimate of the cost was given, with the model of a
car composed of three trucks, which it was proposed to
use if the shipment was made. Since then nothing
has been heard of the eighty ton guns. The officer in
command of the British Columbia district does not
speak very creditably of the condition of the armament
at that point. The artillery armament is described as
old, the carriages and limbers are reported rotten and
are falling to pieces, while the guns are without sights.
The batteries at Victoria and Esquimault, the officers
say, are in a discreditable condition.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Evening

<p class="caption">LA FOLLETTE'S BOOT CRIMPER.</p>
</div>

<p>The crimper herewith illustrated has a yoke-shaped
stationary portion, the jaws of which are formed with
transverse corrugations. The top of this yoke has a
longitudinal slot, in which are pivoted the upper reduced
ends of movable inner jaws, whose operative
faces have transverse corrugations, arranged to always
meet and fit within the corresponding corrugations of
the outer jaws. These inner jaws are normally held
open by a spring. The operating or crimping screw
slides freely through the slot in the yoke, extending between
the inner jaws, and on its lower portion fits a
wedge-shaped clamping block, which is drawn up between
the inner jaws by turning the operating screw.
The outer end of this screw being placed in an aperture
in the heel of the last, or in other suitable position
relative to a form over which the leather is to be
crimped, and the edges of the leather placed between
the jaws, the leather may be strained about its forming
block as desired by simply rotating the screw.</p>

<h2 id="PLASTERERS_HAWK">PLASTERER'S HAWK.</h2>

<p>The object of this invention, which has been patented
by Mr. Geo. W. Jaques, of Burton, O., is to provide a
plasterer's hawk in which the board on which the mortar
is received, and which is subjected to expansion
and contraction due to alternate moistening and drying,
may be rendered light and rigid and, at the same
time, be free to expand and contract without warping
or cracking. In the center of the board is secured a
bolt, upon which is received a handle having a nut in
its outer end fitting the end of the bolt. A circular
concave plate is placed on the bolt, between the handle
and board, with its concave side toward the board.
Between the plate and board is held an elastic rubber
washer, which is compressed by screwing the handle
down.</p>

<p>The plate has a plane edge, which is secured to the
board by screws, and in the edge are four notches for
receiving the ends of wire frames that extend a short
distance under the plate, by which they are clamped
to the board. Each frame consists of a wire, bent to
the shape shown in the upper view in the engraving.
Through the end loops are passed screws, projecting
from the board, and the center of each frame is secured
to the board by a clip, the clips and bolt being arranged
in a line parallel with the grain of the wood.
The frames support the edges of the board, and the
loops permit of the lateral movement of their screws
and the portions of the board by which they are carried.
This hawk weighs, even when thoroughly
soaked, only one pound and a half, the old style weighing
from three to five pounds.</p>

<h2 id="ADJUSTABLE_WOOD_MEASURING_RACK">ADJUSTABLE WOOD MEASURING RACK.</h2>

<p>By means of this device wood may be measured by
the cord or fractional parts of a cord, as occasion may
require. The sill frame consists of two longitudinally
ranging timbers connected by cross bars. Near one
end of the timbers are fixed uprights, braced to each
other and to the timbers. To the inner faces of the
sills are screwed a series of headed pins, the first one
being exactly one foot from the inner face of the end
posts, and the others being spaced one foot apart. Two
posts, braced together by rods, are adapted to stand on
the sills, and to the inside face of each post is attached,
by coach screws, a metal plate provided with a hook at
its lower end, adapted to engage with the shank of one
of the headed screw pins of the sills. Attached to each
post is a brace with two arms, and formed at its lower
end with a notch to engage the pins on the sills. The
metal plates and braces are slotted for the passage of
the screws, so that the movable frame may be quickly
and easily set perfectly plumb, whichever opposite pair
of the sill pins may be engaged by the hooked plates.
The posts are exactly four feet high, and one is marked
by cross lines one foot apart. It is apparent that, to
measure a cord, the frame is moved to the eighth set
of pins and the wood is piled to the tops of the posts.
To measure half a cord, the hooks are engaged with
the fourth pins. By adjusting the hooks to the first
pair of pins, and filling the wood in between the end
posts up to the first cross line on the post, a single foot
of wood can be measured, or up to the second line for
two feet, and so on. Thus a cord or any fractional part
can be readily measured. To disengage the frame, it is
only necessary to tilt it forward toward the fixed posts,
when it may be shifted to any point along the sill
frame.</p>

<h2 id="PENBERTHY_INJECTOR">PENBERTHY INJECTOR.</h2>

<p>At last a mechanical combination and device has been
produced, and a man's labor and study crowned with
success, in the production, for the convenience of
engineers, of a simple and compact device known as
the Penberthy injector or boiler feeder.</p>

<p>Its mechanical construction is very simple, but perfect.
All its parts are movable and convenient of access
(not being screwed in), its working so complete that an
inexperienced person can operate it with success and
perfectness. Its adaptability to all classes of boilers,
such as stationary, portable, traction, marine, and
locomotive, and its working on each, makes it very desirable,
and recommends it to all classes of engineers.
The automatic working of this injector is of very great
advantage, as by this mechanical construction it works
under all conditions of shakes, jars, and concussions. In
case of a break, or the suction is to be removed and then
returned, it picks up or begins working without any
aid, assistance, or attention from the engineer, thereby
relieving of much care and annoyance. Its convenience
of access is of very great consideration and importance,
owing to the advantage of cleaning and examining
its interior parts.</p>

<p>The working parts of this injector are stationary in
their work, thereby causing comparatively no wear in
its mechanical parts. The inventor seems to have
combined common sense with mechanical science, by
leaving out all complications, and combining in the
injector every convenience of operating, getting at,
and putting it on the boiler.</p>

<p>The body is of a single cylinder or barrel, with two
jets inside, "steam and combining," and governed by
an automatic swinging overflow. The injector is operated
by the opening or closing of the globe valves. It
is connected to the boiler and pipes with uniform and
interchangeable square centered unions, and can be
put on or taken off very quickly without any annoyance
or injury, and the only tool required being an
ordinary wrench.</p>

<p>Another great point gained in this injector is its
great range of working capacity. It will lift water twenty-five
feet perpendicular, or take it a hydraulic pressure
and force it into the boiler at a temperature of from
140° to 180° Fah. It will work under a steam pressure
of from 20 to 140 lb. It will also lift and force water
at a very warm temperature (say 120° Fah.) in tank
or well, and under all circumstances and at all points
it works automatically. The inventor and manufacturers
of the Penberthy injector have great confidence
in its working qualities, and to satisfy engineers of its
merits and perfectness of work, solicit a trial. From observation,
a brilliant future is in store for this little
wonder of simplicity and compactness, which is a
model of mechanism in appearance and finish.</p>

<h2 id="PROTECTOR_FOR_LADIES_HATS">PROTECTOR FOR LADIES' HATS.</h2>

<p>This simple and readily adjustable protector may be
quickly applied to and removed from a hat or bonnet,
without injuring its delicate trimmings, and may be
adjusted to fit large or small hats. The main portion
of the protector, which alone will be used to cover hats
of small or medium size, consists of a piece of some
light waterproof fabric strengthened about the margin
with an inside facing. At the inner face of the body
are secured a couple of narrow strips of suitable fabric
(Fig. 2), forming casings for drawing strings. At the opposite
edges of the facing are attached small rings,
through either series of which a drawing string may be
passed.</p>

<p>The extension piece (Fig. 1) of the protector consists
of an endless band of waterproof fabric, like that of
the body, provided at its edges with bindings, to which
rings for drawing strings are secured. The protector
can readily be adjusted and held upon a small or
medium sized hat by properly manipulating the drawing
strings. To adapt the protector to a large hat, the
extension piece is united to the main piece by a string
passed through the inner series of rings on the facing
and through one of the series of rings on the extension
piece. A string is then passed through the other rings
of the extension piece, when the protector can be held
to the hat by adjusting the drawing strings. It is
evident that this protector may be applied over a hat
without danger of crushing the most delicate trimmings.</p>

<h2 id="IMPROVED_STUMP_PULLER">IMPROVED STUMP PULLER.</h2>

<p>The stump puller shown in the accompanying engraving
(<a href="#p130c">page 130</a>) is exceedingly powerful, as, by a system
of compound levers, a pull of one pound on the
operating bar will exert a pull of 384 pounds on the
stump, and if the lifting chain be passed around a single
pulley, this power is doubled. With one of these
machines one man has pulled a green maple stump two
feet in diameter from clay soil. The pulling mechanism
is supported by a tripod, to the upper end of which
is secured a chain carrying a bar or plate provided
with a bearing in which slides a notched bar. Meshing
with the notches of this bar are the teeth of a pawl,
which is so connected, by levers, with the operating
handle that the downward movement of the latter will
raise the pawl and notched bar and the chain attached
to its lower end. A sliding bolt then holds the notched
bar in its raised position, when the handle can be
raised to enable the pawl to engage with the next lower
teeth of the bar. Thus, by a succession of up and
down movements of the handle, the notched bar may
be elevated its entire length, or until the stump is
pulled completely out. It will be seen that the sliding
bolt permits of the upward, but prevents the downward,
movement of the notched bar when the pawl is
disengaged and slides downward. But, by means of a
suitably arranged hand lever, the pawl may be moved
so as to be out of contact with the bar, and, at the
same time, the bolt, which is pressed forward by a
spring, may be moved to disengage it from the notch
in the bar, which may then be adjusted in any desired
position. The machine is built of steel and malleable
iron.</p>

Tichenor and P. Walker, of Henning, Minn.</p>

<p>The idea seems to prevail that the United States is
absolutely helpless against a naval attack from England.
I think this idea is entirely erroneous. There
is the pneumatic gun, capable now of throwing 300 lb.
of nitro-glycerine, which amount could easily be increased
to 1,000 lb. For the value of one modern ironclad,
150 steamers with such a gun could be put in
service in two weeks by the United States, because any
steamer of 100 feet or over would answer; while the
gun, being a mere tube, subjected to but 1,000 lb. of air
per square inch, with air-compressing machinery, is
all so available and quickly built that a month would
put the United States into possession of 500 of them.
If, now, 20 such steamers be told off for each ironclad
sent against us, even if two-thirds were sunk, they
would, before being entirely demolished, succeed in depositing
5 to 10 tons of nitro-glycerine on the deck of
the ironclad, and exploding it.</p>

<p>Would not the effect of repeated explosions of 1,000
lb. of nitro-glycerine blow the deck in, dismount the
guns and engine, and shake the armor loose, as the
explosions of the Monitors' guns did when they were
in service in the late war&mdash;the heads of bolts and other
fastenings of the armor flying off from the concussion.</p>

<p>Then there is the submarine boat, that has already
stayed under water thirty minutes with its crew, and
been easily and correctly guided. What is in the way
of using ten such boats to each ironclad, one of which
would unquestionably succeed in placing 1,000 lb. of
nitro-glycerine under the ironclad, the explosion of
which would be heard from? Because the explosion of
90 lb. of gun-cotton did not materially damage an ironclad,
can it be reasoned that 1,000 lb. of nitro-glycerine,
which would have twenty-five times the force of 90 lb.
of gun-cotton, would be equally ineffective? Hardly,
I think.</p>

<p>Nets, etc., would not prevent such boats from diving
under them, while they would only impede the speed
and maneuvering of the ironclad, and render her more
easily approached.</p>

<p>Blucher, the German cavalry officer, insisted that it
was the impression and belief existing in Germany that
Napoleon was invincible, and the Germans helpless,
that alone prevented them from conquering. When
the occasion came when he could demonstrate this,
the Germans and allies easily defeated and dethroned
Napoleon.</p>

<p>It is similarly true in this country, for too many
believe that the English ironclad is invincible, and this
impression makes cowards of too many. Give the
nitro-glycerine gun and submarine boat a trial, if occasion
arises, and England's ironclads will succumb as
easily as Napoleon when sufficient power of the right
kind was brought to bear on him. The right kind of
power to apply to England is nitro-glycerine and
dynamite, which could be ready with guns and boats
in a month or less. One hundred days sufficed to
build the first Monitor many years ago, and much less
time will be needed for dynamite guns.</p>

<h2 id="Electroplating_with_Platinum">Electroplating with Platinum.</h2>

<p>Platinum has not been much used in electroplating,
notwithstanding its hard, durable, and protective properties.
This is, perhaps, chiefly owing to the practical
difficulty of obtaining a good firm "reguline"
deposit. A process for effecting this has, however,
been brought out recently by a Mr. Bright, whose
patents have been acquired by the Bright Platinum
Plating Company, and are in actual operation in London
at works established there. Platinum has the
advantage of keeping its color where silver, brass, or
copper becomes discolored, and will, to some extent at
least, replace the use of these metals in electrotyping.
It will be highly useful in plating chemists' crucibles
and so on. German silver, for example, plated
with platinum can be used to manipulate strong acids.
By the Bright process, platinum can be deposited on
any surface which can be electroplated with other
metals.</p>

<h2 id="Charleston_Earthquake">Coincidence of Charleston Earthquake with a
Reported Eruption in the Tonga Group.</h2>

<p><i>To the Editor of the Scientific American:</i></p>

<p>I would like to call your attention to a reported coincidence,
described in a letter in the London <i>Times</i>
of December last. An interview with captain and
crew of a vessel just then arrived at Sydney, Australia,
from Tonga Islands, is given. The captain is represented
assaying that while lying off the islands on
the night of the 31st of August, 1886, he observed a
most terrific eruption of a volcano situated on one of
them, accompanied by earthquake shocks, and the
vessel received showers of dust and ashes. The occurrence
on the same night with the Charleston earthquake
on this continent is curious, to say the least.
The statement might be acceptable to those of your
readers interested in seismic disturbances.</p>

<p>I write to relate an incident which may be of interest
to some of the readers of your valuable paper.
There is a bar iron mill, situated in a neighboring
town four miles from here, that has been on fire three
or four times, in which the English sparrow might be
called the incendiary. These sparrows pick up old
pieces of cotton waste, which they build in their
nests, among the timbers of the roof of the mill, and
in every case of the fires above mentioned, these nests
were the cause, either from spontaneous combustion
or from sparks from the hot iron striking and lodging
in the nest. If you could suggest some way of getting
rid of the sparrows, I think the manager of the mill
would be glad to adopt your plan.</p>

<h2 id="Charcoal_as_Fossil">Charcoal as Fossil.</h2>

<p><i>To the Editor of the Scientific American:</i></p>

<p>Perhaps charcoal has not often been observed as occurring
naturally with mineral coal, though, as a result
of metamorphism, graphite is not uncommon in
coal districts.</p>

<p>In a variety of bituminous coal that comes from
Tennessee, and that is largely used in this State,
there are to be seen along in the cleavage planes
films of true charcoal, in varying quantity, but commonly
thin. This coal has been coming to us for
several years, and all the while I have noticed in it
the presence of the charcoal. I have scarcely ever
put coal into the fire without making the observation;
and there is perhaps not a lump, of size at all considerable,
that does not contain these films.</p>

<p>On close examination, I have frequently found that
the surface of the films on the broken lumps contains
a delicate tracery, closely resembling vegetable impressions.
The tracery is not so well marked as a
fossil imprint, but not so indistinct as to escape notice.</p>

<p>In reading of the habits of the wading birds, and

give any account of their manner of attracting
their prey at night. My attention was called to the
matter while gigging for fish, by frequently observing
dim phosphoric lights appear and disappear along the
shore like jack o' lanterns, which I for a long time
supposed them to be. Oh one occasion I fired at
such a light, and brought down a large blue crane, on
which the phosphoric spots were clearly visible after
death. There are two such spots; the larger being
high up on the breast and the smaller at the bottom
of the breast bone, the bird having power to reveal
and conceal them at will. I have since stuffed many
of the water walkers, and find that all have the same
general arrangement of the feathers, and, as I believe,
the same power of lighting up the water to attract
the fish. Will some naturalist who is posted on this
subject please throw some further light upon it, for the
benefit of science?</p>

<p>A correspondent in British Columbia, who is engaged
in the business, gives us the following practical
information:</p>

<p>Noticing your reply to a correspondent anent canned
goods, I recently opened several cans of salmon
that were processed in July of 1879, 1880, 1881, and on
comparing them with last season's cans, found it impossible
to detect the slightest difference. I hold that
if a can is once perfectly sealed, the contents will remain
unaltered as long as the metal casing remains
intact.</p>

<p>A can will keep if every portion of the contents has
been subjected to a temperature of 212° Fah., whether
the air is expelled or not, as my experiments have
conclusively proved.</p>

<p>When I first began the business, I was taught that
the air unless expelled would cause the contents to
deteriorate, and that was the reason the cans were
vented. I soon found it was a mistake. The venting
is done for the purpose of testing for leaks. A
tight can has a sound that cannot be mistaken for a
leaky one. If your correspondent boils his fish, flesh,
or fowl with the vents open, he will have dry cans
for his pains. The vents must be closed when cooking,
and opened, in the case of meats, after boiling
one hour, then closed and returned to kettle, and boil
three hours for fish and less for meat without bone.
Fruit is vented and closed when finished.</p>

<h2 id="OUR_WINTER_BIRDS">OUR WINTER BIRDS.<br />

<small>BY E. M. HASBROUCK.</small></h2>

<p>It is a popular belief that the woods and fields in winter
time are void of bird life, and are what they appear
at a distance&mdash;a cold, bleak, and desolate waste.</p>

<p>This opinion, however, is not correct. It is true that
the birds, which were so numerous during the summer,
have left us and gone to their winter homes, but as
they departed an entirely different fauna started from
a colder climate, and gradually took their place. I refer
to the birds of the northern part of Canada and the
fur countries, whose summer homes are in these desolate
regions, and which on the approach of winter are
driven southward, making a temporary stay with us
until the rigors of an Arctic winter shall have departed,
and once more left their homes in an inhabitable condition.</p>

<div id="p133" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p133.jpg"
alt="" />
</div>

<p>A glance at these birds will take one into the same
localities that have been so often traversed in the summer
time, and once within the woods, the fact that they
are cold and leafless is lost sight of. One can now find
birds entirely different from any that he has heretofore
seen, and at the same time learn several facts of interest
concerning birds with which he considers himself well
acquainted; as, for instance, the American goldfinch,
which is supposed to migrate in the fall, will be found
in the swampy woods in large flocks, but with plumage
so changed that they will probably not be recognized,
being of a somber brown color, and sexes undistinguishable.
Why hundreds of a species, the majority of
which migrate regularly, and which do not reach us
until late in the spring, should change their dress and
remain with us throughout our most severe winters is
a problem.</p>

<p>In company with them will often be found the pine
linnet and common red poll. These little finches are
rather rare, and are seldom found together in any great
numbers. They leave the North in large flocks, but as
they journey southward break up into smaller and
smaller companies, until only a few are left together.
These join interests with the nearest goldfinches, and
remain with them throughout the winter.</p>

<p>The results of a visit to the fields, on some clear day,
will often repay a somewhat wearisome tramp. The
snow buntings and shore larks frequent such places in
large numbers, and a locality where the ground has
been swept bare of snow, or is covered with a growth
of weeds, is a favorite feeding ground.</p>

<p>Their food consists entirely of the seeds, and a spot
once chosen by them is seldom forsaken until all in this
line has been eaten.</p>

<p>The buntings will be found in flocks of from a dozen
to two hundred, and in some even more. Their appearance
when flying is pure white, but the upper
parts of a specimen in the hand will be found mostly
black. They are extremely shy, and when approached
spring into the air and dart away in a manner that
would indicate their intention of departing for the next
county; but should you return that way in the course
of half an hour, you will, in all probability, find them
in the same place.</p>

<p>The shore larks, although feeding on the same
grounds, seldom mix with the buntings, preferring to
keep in flocks by themselves, and are worthy of attention,
inasmuch as they have one marked peculiarity;
this is the small tuft of feathers on each side of the
head, resembling minute horns, which are raised and
lowered at pleasure. (See cut.)</p>

<p>The majority of these birds reach us at the approach
of cold weather, although a few spend the summer here
and rear their young. They are less timid than the
snow bunting, and may often be approached quite
close.</p>

<p>These two species form about all the attraction to be
found to any extent in the fields, and, aside from an occasional
hawk, only one more species frequents them,
a species that is worth going miles to see&mdash;the snowy
owl.</p>

<p>These birds reach us about the last of November and
remain until the last of February, frequenting the
neighborhood of some body of water, and seldom straying
from it more than a mile or two. To see them and
become at all acquainted with their habits, one must face
all kinds of weather, possess untiring energy, and must
undergo a considerable amount of fatigue. He will
find them in the open country (as they frequent such
ground altogether, seldom, if ever, entering the woods),
perched on some fence post or stump, where, if undisturbed,
they will remain for a considerable length of
time, intently watching for mice, of which their food
largely consists, set off by an occasional rabbit. They
are extremely rare. One may tramp the fields for several
days without success, and then again find one the
first hour out.</p>

<p>On December 20, 1886, the writer started on a trip to
Oneida Lake, N. Y., intending to devote his attention
entirely to these birds; was gone four days, and saw
five birds. This, of course, was exceptional, but shows
what may happen.</p>

<p>In the dense pine and hemlock swamps several other
species of owls are found, which are much more numerous
at this season than in the summer. These are the
long eared and short eared owls, with an occasional
barred owl; but the most interesting of all is the
Acadian or saw-whet, one of the smallest of the family
and little known. It is far from common, being met
with only at intervals. Its note, which closely resembles
the filing of a large saw, occasionally betrays it; while
at the same time it has a tendency to stray into barns
and out-buildings, thus affording an opportunity for
capture.</p>

<p>As it is not generally known, a description may be of
some benefit. "Upper parts, including wings and
tail, uniform chocolate-brown, spotted with white;
under parts white, thickly streaked lengthwise with
the color of the back; face, white."</p>

<p>In general appearance, they are the same as all owls,
but when seen in the woods have a somewhat comical
appearance, owing to their wise look for so small a
bird.</p>

<p>We have often heard of the shrikes, or butcher birds,
that capture small birds and impale them on the thorns
of bushes. Many of us have wished to see them, and
wondered where and when they were to be found.
Now is the time. Any clump of bushes or young second-growth
is a likely place to find them, for there are
two species which visit us every winter and frequent
these places. These are the great northern and loggerhead
shrikes, the latter being most common; both bear
a general resemblance, but differ mainly in size and in
markings on the under parts. One can find them almost
any day, perched on the topmost branch of some tree
or bush, steadily eyeing the surrounding bushes in
search of some victim, while on a thornbush near by
will be found numberless moles, mice, and an occasional
bird, awaiting the appetite of the marauder.</p>

<p>Aside from the goldfinches, many other birds of different
species, instead of migrating with the rest, remain
behind, and are to be found, on almost any pleasant
day, in the warmer and more secluded parts of the
swamp. Among these are the robin, golden-winged,
downy, and hairy woodpeckers, the white-bellied nuthatch,
and chickadees. These last are, perhaps, the
most numerous of all our winter birds; whole flocks
roam from one end of the swamp to the other, and I
think there is no pleasanter sound to be heard in the
woods in winter than to hear their clear "chick-a-dee-de-de-de"
from a score of little throats, or to see them
clinging to the branches and acting as familiarly as
though no one was within sight or hearing. An occasional
meadow lark will be flushed from the tall grass
in some sheltered spot, while on the open streams will
be found black ducks and mallards, whistlers and
mergansers of two species, the hooded and buff-breasted
or common sheldrake.</p>

<p>Truly, then, with all this material awaiting us, the
fields and forests will be found inviting, and you who
have never traversed them in winter do so now, and
get a new interest awakened in them.</p>

<h2 id="THERMOSCOPIC_BALANCE">THERMOSCOPIC BALANCE.<br />

<small>BY GEO. M. HOPKINS.</small></h2>

<p>The action of this instrument is due to the facility
with which liquids evaporate in a vacuum. A small
amount of heat is sufficient to vaporize the liquid to the
extent required to secure the desired action. The instrument
is provided with a glass tube bent twice at right
angles, and having a bulb blown on each end. The
tube and the bulbs are partly filled with water, and a
vacuum is secured by boiling the water in the bulbs
before sealing them. The center of the tube is furnished
with V-pivots, which rest in bearings in the
top of the forked column. The column
also supports a metal screen,
which is bright one side and black
on the other. Two pins project
from the shield, to limit the movements
of the glass tube and bulbs.</p>

<p>When the instrument is in use,
the screen is placed toward the
source of heat, and when radiant
heat strikes the bulb which is unshielded
by the screen, the water in
that bulb is vaporized, and sufficient
pressure is produced to drive
the water upward into the bulb
behind the screen. When a little
more than half of the water has
been in this manner forced from
the lower to the higher bulb, the
upper bulb preponderates. The
tube and bulbs are supported on
their pivot so as to secure unstable
equilibrium, so that, when the
upper bulb begins to descend, it
completes its excursion at once, and
exposes the full bulb to the radiant
heat, at the same time carrying
its empty bulb behind the screen,
where it cools. The transfer of the
water from the full bulb to the
empty one now occurs as before.
This operation is repeated so long as the bulbs are
exposed to the action of radiant heat. The oscillations
may be quickened by smoking the sides of the bulbs
remote from the screen, and still greater rapidity of
action may be secured by concentrating the heat on
the bulbs by means of condensers or reflectors.</p>

<h2 id="The_Duration_of_the_Sun">The Duration of the Sun.</h2>

<p>The <i>Builders' Weekly Reporter</i> (London) has an interesting
account of a lecture at the Royal Institute,
given by Professor Sir William Thomson, on the latest
dynamical theories regarding the "probable origin,
total amount, and possible duration of the sun's heat."
During the short 3,000 years or more of which man
possesses historic records there was, the learned physicist
showed, no trace of variation in solar energy; and
there was no distinct evidence of it even though the
earth, as a whole, from being nearer the sun, received
in January 6½ per cent more heat than in July. But
in the millions of years which geology carried us
back, it might safely be said there must have been
great changes. How had the solar fires been maintained
during those ages? The scientific answer to
this question was the theory of Helmholtz that the
sun was a vast globe gradually cooling, but as it
cooled, shrinking, and that the shrinkage&mdash;which was
the effect of gravity upon its mass&mdash;kept up its temperature.
The total of the sun's heat was equal
to that which would be
required to keep up
476,000 millions of millions
of millions horse
power, or about 78,000
horse power for every
square meter&mdash;a little
more than a square yard&mdash;and
yet the modern
dynamical theory of
heat shows that the
sun's mass would require
only to fall in or
contract thirty-five
meters per annum to
keep up that tremendous
energy. At this
rate, the solar radius in
2,000 years' time would
be about one hundredth
per cent less than at
present. A time would
come when the temperature
would fall, and it
was thus inconceivable
that the sun would continue
to emit heat sufficient
to sustain existing
life on the globe for
more than 10,000,000
years. Applying the
same principles retrospectively,
they could
not suppose that the sun had existed for more than
twenty million years, no matter what might have been
its origin&mdash;whether it came into existence from the
clash of worlds pre-existing, or of diffused nebulous
matter. There was a great clinging by geologists
and biologists to vastly longer periods, but the physicist,
treating it as a dynamic question with calculable
elements, could come to no other conclusion materially
different from what he had stated. Sir William
Thomson declined to discuss any chemical source of
heat, which, whatever its effect when primeval elements
first came into contact, was absolutely insignificant
compared with the effects of gravity after globes
like the sun and the earth had been formed. In all
these speculations they were in the end driven to the
ultimate elements of matter, to the question&mdash;when
they thought what became of all the sun's heat&mdash;what
is the luminiferous ether that fills space, and to that
most wonderful form of force upon which Faraday
spent so much of the thought of his later years&mdash;gravity.
The lecture was heard with deep interest and
close attention.</p>

<h2 id="Hydraulic_Dredging_at">Hydraulic Dredging at
Washington.</h2>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Engineers'
Club of Philadelphia, a paper
by Conway B. Hunt was read on
hydraulic dredging machinery.</p>

<p>The paper mentions the early application
of the principle of hydraulic
dredging, that is, the mixing
of dredged material with water and
then removing the mixture by suction
or otherwise; and after referring
briefly to the Roy Stone and
Bowers dredges as typical machines,
describes in detail the Von Schmidt
dredge. Two of these dredges are
engaged on the improvement of the
Potomac River at Washington, D. C.,
under the United States Government.
Each is 100 feet by 50 feet,
with a semicircular bow, around
which travels a vertical suction
pipe, 22 in. in diameter, and telescopic.
At its foot is a conical hood, beneath which
works a rotary excavating plow, 8 feet in diameter.
The suction is produced by a powerful centrifugal
pump, run by a 200 horse power engine.</p>

<p>The discharge pipe is 20 in. in diameter, has rubber
hose joint connections, and is carried to the shore on
pontoons. The material was mixed with from three to
ten times its volume of water, and discharged at distances
up to 3,500 feet from the dredge, and at from
6 to 10 feet above water. A year's record shows an
average of 175 cubic yards per working hour, and 2,300
yards per day, for each dredge. The work was done,
by contract, at prices of 12.37 cts., 15 cts., and 15.45 cts.
per cubic yard, which includes the cost of levees to
confine the semi fluid material, drains to carry off the
water, etc. The final estimates were specified to be
taken by cross sections of the completed fill after it had
become solidified and compacted. In conclusion, it is
noted that the devices and details of hydraulic dredging
machines are the subjects of numerous patents,
and their most efficient combination may be long deferred.
The large number of machines that are still

that the best results attainable from this class of
dredges have not yet been accomplished.</p>

<h2 id="THE_NORTHERN_LIGHTS">THE NORTHERN LIGHTS.</h2>

<p>When, in 1752, Franklin succeeded, through a kite
sent up into a storm cloud, in obtaining an electric
spark at the extremity of the cord, which had been
made a conductor through the rain, it was no
longer possible to doubt that lightning was but
an immense electric discharge between two clouds,
or a discharge between a cloud and the earth.
This discovery was of great importance, since it
connected with the laws of physics certain phenomena
which, until then, had passed for marvelous,
and in which nothing but supernatural
and mysterious manifestations were seen.</p>

<p>The aurora borealis, which is more difficult to
understand, and which necessitates more extended
scientific notions, has remained much longer unexplained.
This enigmatic phenomenon was especially
striking to the imagination of ancient peoples.
It was regarded as an omen of inauspicious
events, and the historians who describe it affirm
that, at times, armies have been seen passing
through the bloody heavens, and that the clash of
arms has been heard.</p>

<p>It is now known that the aurora borealis has
the same origin as lightning, that it is one of
the visible manifestations of atmospheric electricity,
and that it is due to slow movements of
that fluid, while lightning is the result of violent
motions. The effects of the aurora and of the thunderbolt
are absolutely different; but between them there
is an intermediary that connects them, and this is heat
lightning.</p>

<p>These elementary notions are now the property of
science; but the study of the aurora has hitherto been
only partially outlined.
Travelers and physicists have,
indeed, given numerous descriptions,
but it has remained
to find the bonds that unite
these so important phenomena
in the economy of the
globe, to study the causes
that set them in action, to
observe the correlations that
they may offer, and to discuss
theories. This is a labor that
Mr. S. Lemstrom has been
engaged in for several years,
and we now propose to analyze
the results published by
this great Finnish physicist.</p>

<p>The author of this important
work, who has long
been occupied in the study
of the aurora borealis, so
frequent in his country, was
attached to the polar expedition
made in 1868 by Nordenskjold.
He was led to
begin a series of important
observations. In 1871 he visited
Finnish Lapland, and,
after a series of ingenious
researches, constructed an
apparatus that permitted him
to artificially reproduce the
light of the aurora, and to present science with a
summary of new and incontestable facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemstrom has observed a large number of auroræ,
and before touching upon theoretic questions, we
shall give his description of one of the phenomena
that seems to him to be
the completest. On the 18th
of October, 1868, the steamer
Sophia was nearing the coast
of Norway, after battling with
a furious sea for three days in
succession.</p>

<p>"To the west of the horizon
we remarked two strata of
clouds that were clearly separated
by a blue band of the
heavens, crossed by a band
striated with a pale yellow.
It was the feeble beginning
of an aurora, whose splendor
was soon to surpass all the
phenomena of the same kind
that we had up till then observed.
The edges of the
upper stratum of clouds
gradually lighted up, and we
soon saw isolated flames
issuing from them that sometimes
rose to the zenith.
Suddenly, the phenomenon
embraced the entire horizon.
Everywhere were flames,
everywhere were jets of brilliant
light, yellow below,
green in the center, and
reddish violet above. In an
instant, all the rays united
in a regular and dazzling crown, situated in the
heavens to the south of the zenith. When the
phenomenon reached the maximum of its intensity, it
reminded us of the immense vault of a temple, with
a brilliant chandelier in the center. The apparition
lasted but a few minutes, but, on vanishing, left behind
it a luminous zone between the banks of clouds.
From the upper bank there continued to emanate, at
short intervals, isolated rays that rose to the zenith,
and there formed the fragments of a crown. The
edges of the banks of clouds remained luminous, although
the rays had disappeared."</p>

</div>

<p>According to Mr. Lemstrom, Fig. 1 gives an idea,
although a feeble one, of the phenomenon at its height.
It reproduces only half of the horizon, and the reader
may supply the missing portion of this grand spectacle
in imagination. The streams of light verging toward
a common center were alternately rose colored and pale
yellow, and overlooked an immense violet zone. The
rosette in the center was of a beautiful red,
and stood out upon a greenish blue circle.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 represents an aurora that was observed
on the 19th of November, 1871, in Finnish Lapland.
At the beginning, and at 30° above the
horizon, it formed an arch from whence rose
waves of light, and which gradually ascended.
The figure shows it when it had reached about
60° above the horizon. The base of the aurora
was yellow, and the oblique and very brilliant
rays were, slightly higher up, rosy, violet, and
blue. The colors of the polar light are usually
clear and bright, but never did they exhibit
greater luster than on this occasion.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 gives an idea of the variety of forms
that the phenomenon may affect. It represents
an aurora that was observed at the presbytery of
Enare on the 16th of November, 1871. The
aurora this time took on the form of a glowing
red band, curved as shown in the figure. The
two extremities bordered on yellow and green.</p>

<p>There is another form of aurora frequently observed
in northern countries, and that is the one
that is seen to occur above clouds, and that has
the appearance of a wide piece of drapery with undulating
folds. As it is the form most usually represented,
we shall not dwell upon it. On the contrary,
we shall speak of other phenomena of the same
origin, and much less known, that Mr. Lemstrom
describes. It concerns those auroral lights that shine
at the edges of clouds, or that
form around the tops of the
mountains in Spitzbergen or
in the Alpine districts of Lapland.
According to the Finnish
observer, it would be impossible
to tell by the naked
eye whence this light comes,
but, by means of a spectroscope,
we find that it is of
the same nature as the aurora.
Sometimes, these strange
lights take on the form of
flames of but little brightness,
which, at short intervals,
rise from the crest of
the mountain and suddenly
vanish (Fig. 4).</p>

<p>These phenomena sometimes
exhibit themselves at
the level of the earth's surface,
or upon the roofs of
houses.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Lemstrom describes
the diffuse light which
sometimes fills the atmosphere
of the polar regions,
thus proving that the phenomenon
shows itself from
time to time in the vicinity
of the earth itself.</p>

<p>Meteors of the same nature
as the light of the auroræ boreales do not occur solely
in the polar regions, and the author demonstrates,
not without attaching much importance to it from
the standpoint of the theories to which he has been
led, that they are observed in other countries of the
earth. In Peru, Bolivia, and
Chili the summits of the
mountains are often seen illuminated
by a brilliant light.
This light, which occurs especially
in summer, has been
compared to heat lightning
by scientists.</p>

<p>Similar observations have
been made in the Swiss Alps.
Dr. De Saussure has seen
electricity escape through all
the projecting parts of objects,
and the same phenomena
have been observed
upon the high plateaus of
Mexico. Again, we may cite
the fact that Brewster observed
a light upon a church
tower during an aurora borealis.
In every country phenomena
similar to polarized
light may occur.&mdash;<i>La Nature</i>.</p>

<h2 id="EFFECT_OF_A_TORPEDO_ON_AN_IRONCLAD">EFFECT OF A TORPEDO ON AN IRONCLAD.</h2>

<p>The British government lately strengthened up the
bottom of the old ironclad Resistance, and tried the
effect of firing off a 90 lb. guncotton torpedo against
the vessel. To the surprise of every
one, the ship was not seriously damaged.
The <i>Engineer</i> comments upon
the experiment as follows:</p>

<p>The Resistance experiments so far
tend to demonstrate that the total
disablement or destruction of a modern
ironclad is not so easy as many
people imagined. It was too hastily
assumed that the explosion of a charge
of 90 lb. of guncotton in contact with
any portion of the hull under water
would have such destructive effect as
to overcome the protection afforded
by a thick lining of coal and the cellular
system of construction now always
adopted in vessels of war. There are,
however, certain considerations attached
to this experiment which, if
duly weighed, should reassure the
advocates of the torpedo, and restrain
the exultation of naval architects within
reasonable bounds. We shall endeavor
to place these before our readers
briefly and impartially, reserving a
fuller summing-up until the remaining
experiments are concluded, as they are
of greater importance than any of
those preceding. It is the more essential
to do this because the <i>Times</i>, in
a leading article of November 3, leads
us to believe that as this attack failed,
in the broad sense of the word, similar
attempts under different conditions
would have a like result: and that
although serious damage would be
caused, the ship would remain "floating
and seaworthy, with her offensive
powers not materially impaired." We are not prepared
to accept this conclusion, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>First, let us consider the general effect of a submarine
explosion. It closely resembles the action of gunpowder
when ignited in a gun. We know that in the
latter case a quantity of heated gas is formed, which
in its power of expansion exerts force in all directions.
Prevented from expanding by its rigid confinement,
except in the direction of the bore, the gas attains its
object by the displacement of the projectile. This is,
in fact, the line of least resistance. When the same explosive
is ignited under water, the heated gas presses
outward in all directions, forcing the surrounding
molecules of water against their neighbors, which are,
in turn, propelled forward with great violence. This
effect continues until the back pressure of the liquid
medium equals the now reduced pressure of the gas
due to its expansion in the space vacated by the displaced
water, which is likewise to some extent compressed
by the action of the gas. Though brought actually
to a state of rest, the surrounding water is
under the influence of great pressure, which by the
law of fluids is transmitted equally in all directions.
When a vessel is sufficiently near the explosion to be
struck by the water which has been so violently disturbed,
it will act upon her like a huge projectile, and
it is obvious this range will be in proportion to the
amount of explosive employed. This, combined with
the resistance her hull offers, will also determine the
effect produced.</p>

<p>If the charge is too near the surface of the water, the
liquid layer above it will not restrain the liberated gas
sufficiently to allow of its full power being exerted in
other directions, and hence permits its escape into the
atmosphere, throwing up the water in its way to a greater
or less height, according to the thickness of the layer.
The spectacular effect, therefore, afforded by the upheaval
of a large and lofty column of water is no criterion
of the efficiency of a submarine explosion, but, on
the contrary, shows that much of its energy has been
expended in the wrong direction. The amount of submersion
to give the greatest lateral effect to different
charges of explosive has been ascertained by practical
experiments. For 100 lb. of gunpowder, it is stated to
be 10 ft., while for the same quantity of guncotton it
should be 15 ft. As the charge employed against the
Resistance was 90 lb. of guncotton placed 10 ft. below
the surface, it is probable that some loss of power was
sustained in the manner we have indicated. At a
greater depth also the charge would have been to some
extent under the vessel, where its explosive effect would
have been more severe, and where the construction of
the hull cannot be as strongly fortified with coal as
was the case in the Resistance. We are unable to state
why a depth of 10 ft. was selected on this occasion;
but it may be due to the fact that up to a late date
most of our locomotive torpedoes have not carried a
larger charge than 40 lb. of guncotton, and are usually
run at 10 ft. below the surface.</p>

<p>Considerable stress has been laid on the fact that in
this experiment the charge was in actual contact, and
yet did not effect complete penetration. It is even
gravely asserted that an actual torpedo would have
rebounded a certain distance before explosion took
place, and this would diminish its effect. In the first
place, the detonation of guncotton is practically instantaneous,
so that impact and explosion would be
simultaneous. We are hardly prepared to allow an
inch rebound, but will concede that until actual proof
convicts us of error. In the second place, it is possible
that a distance of three or four feet between charge
and ship would rather augment than diminish the
effect produced in the case of such an explosive as guncotton
when sufficiently immersed. It is possible the
intervening water thrown against the side of the ship
would do more damage than the gas liberated in actual
contact. At any rate, experiments some years ago
with smaller quantities of both dynamite and guncotton
showed that when exploded 4 ft. from the bottom
of a ship, enormous damage was inflicted on her.</p>

<p>Although it is generally estimated that guncotton is
about four times more powerful than gunpowder, this
does not appear to hold good under all conditions; while,
on the other hand, for certain purposes, ten times the
amount of gunpowder would not produce the same result.
This is proved by the ease with which the
strongest chain cable and wire rope can be ruptured
by a small charge of guncotton, which even more than
ten times the amount of gunpowder could not accomplish.
This is due to the peculiar shattering action of
detonated guncotton, which the slower burning substances
does not possess, its characteristic being more
of the nature of a push than a blow. Taking into consideration
the method in which the hull of the Resistance
had been strengthened for this experiment,
and the exact locality chosen for the explosion, it is
probable that less than twice the amount of gunpowder
would have caused a more complete breach through
the coal protection. The torpedo is stated to have had
everything in its favor; whereas, in our opinion, all
the advantages were on the side of the ship. The attack
was made at her strongest point, where the coal
was specially disposed, and her shape under water lent
no assistance to the explosive. To assume from this
that if a similar torpedo struck lower down, or further
aft, or against the propeller, the ship would still have
"her offensive powers not materially impaired," is to
express an opinion with which few will be found to
concur.</p>

<p>Under the alternative circumstances mentioned, half
the amount of explosive might practically disable the
vessel, though her flotation need not be overcome.
Whitehead torpedoes need not necessarily be limited to
a depth of 10 ft., as by slightly strengthening their
construction they could be run 20 ft. below the surface.
We presume it will be allowed that this would
increase their destructive power, especially in the
vicinity of engines and boilers, which now occupy so
much space. In a similar manner there is no difficulty
in increasing the charge of a locomotive torpedo to a
point at which it becomes irresistible, whatever system
of internal protection may be devised. This has,
in fact, been going on for some time; more than one
nation possesses torpedoes armed with 100 lb. of guncotton,
and if we do not, it is simply because former
experiments led us to believe sufficient damage would
be caused by a less quantity. We can only consider
that disproved on demonstration by further trials
under conditions less favorable to the ship, and we
venture to predict some delusions will then be dispelled
which this particular experiment
seems to have occasioned.</p>

<h2 id="Steel_Wire_Brush_Patent">Steel Wire Brush Patent.</h2>

<p>Before Judges McKennan and Acheson
of the United States Circuit Court
for the Western District of Pennsylvania,
at Pittsburg, Pa., No. 16 of
November term, 1886, a question arose
as to whether a steel wire brush for
cleaning castings, and a steel wire
brush for cleaning boiler flues, was an
infringement on what is generally
known as the Wright patent, No.
59,733, and the reissue, No. 2,598,
owned by Joseph McArthur, of New
York city.</p>

<p>The Wright patent consists of a
wooden block with a series of pairs of
holes. A bundle of wire splints is doubled
and the ends inserted in the holes,
being held by the wooden bridge between
the holes and by a wooden
back screwed to the block.</p>

<p>Joseph H. Davis, of Sewickley, Pa.,
the defendant, under his casting brush
patent, No. 232,600, the construction
of which consists in the doubling of
the wire splints and inserting in one
hole of a wooden block, and fastening
by means of weaving a wire through
the loop, the wire being held in place
by a wooden back fastened on by driving
wrought iron nails through the
block and back and clinching on the
back, thus making the block and back
practically inseparable.</p>

<p>The Davis flue brush patent, No.
181,416, is made by sticking the wire splints through
holes in an iron cylinder, there being no wood about
its construction.</p>

<p>Several cases had been tried in other States involving
the validity of the Wright patent, which had resulted
in Mr. McArthur's favor, but after exhaustive
argument in the case at Pittsburg, Pa., the court held
the Davis brush not to be an infringement on the
Wright patent.</p>

<h2 id="How_Long_Should_a_Nervous_Patient_be_Treated">How Long Should a Nervous Patient be Treated?</h2>

<p>The question of how long treatment should be
continued in a neurotic case when no evident benefit
is produced has recently been raised in a Hamburg
law court. A medical man, says the <i>Lancet</i>, having
as a patient a merchant suffering from "nervousness,"
treated him by galvanism. Altogether he galvanized
him 445 times, but the nervousness did not disappear.
Then came the matter of fees. The sum claimed was
$556. The merchant disputed this on the ground that
the treatment ought not have been continued so long,
as it was not producing any benefit. The court referred
the matter to the medical board, which gave as
its opinion that the doctor ought to have asked the
patient, after some fifty sittings, whether he would
like to continue them, as it was doubtful whether
the treatment was doing any good. The court, however,
declined to accept this view, holding that it
was for the patient to say when he had tried the
treatment as long as he was disposed to pay for it, and
so gave judgment for the full amount claimed. This
judgment seems to accord with the principle that
applies to newspaper subscriptions. A man must pay
for his paper as long as he takes it from the post office.

<h2 id="TORPEDO_BOAT_ARMED_WITH_PNEUMATIC_DYNAMITE">TORPEDO BOAT ARMED WITH PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE
GUNS.</h2>

<p>In former issues of the <span class="smcap">Scientific American</span> we
have given illustrations and detailed descriptions of
the pneumatic dynamite gun invented by Lieutenant
E. L. Zalinski, of the U. S. Artillery Corps. This gun,
it will be remembered, was designed to throw a projectile
loaded with dynamite or nitro-glycerine by
means of compressed air; and so successful were the experiments
carried on with it at Fort Lafayette, under
the supervision of a board of naval experts, that
Congress eventually appropriated $350,000 for building
a swift torpedo boat, large enough to go to sea, and to
be armed with three of these guns. Contracts for this
boat have been signed with the Cramps.</p>

<p>The upper view in the accompanying engraving is
a longitudinal vertical section, the lower one being a
plan view. The following details regarding the boat
we take from the <i>Sun</i>. The boat will be 250 ft. long,
26 ft. beam, and will draw 8 ft. of water. Her displacement
will be about 800 tons. The engines will be of
the triple expansion type, of the best known design,
and the guaranteed power will be 3,200. She will be
propelled by twin screws, and it is expected that the
guaranteed speed of 20 knots an hour will be exceeded.</p>

<p>The three dynamite guns are to be placed side by
side, at the elevation indicated in the upper view. They
are to be fired in their places, but their range can be
varied by increasing or diminishing the charge of air
let in behind the projectile. An extreme range of one
mile is put down in the contract, and the weight of
gelatine to be thrown is 200 pounds; but the guns, as
now building, will throw 400 pounds instead of 200
pounds, and the effective range will probably be about
two miles. Air chambers and compressors of sufficient
size and power are provided to enable fifteen shots to be
fired to the distance of one mile without stopping; but
if the boat were heading for the enemy at full speed,
thirty shells could be thrown before the air would be
exhausted and the cruiser obliged to turn tail. Thirty
shells would mean the explosion of 12,000 pounds of
nitro-glycerine about the enemy.</p>

<p>In fixing the gun permanently in its place, the designer
has followed out the old idea of making the ship
simply a floating gun carriage. The new British cruiser
Polyphemus is built on the same idea, and there are
other floating gun carriages. In this cruiser the firing
is entirely under the control of the officer in the pilot
house. He has simply to head his boat for the enemy,
dash ahead at full speed, and blaze away. The trained
pilot, even in the excitement of battle, would steer his
ship instinctively, so there would be little trouble with
the aim, except, perhaps, in getting the range.</p>

<p>Each gun can be fired once in two minutes, or the
three successively in two minutes.</p>

<p>The new cruiser has a freeboard of about four feet
above water. This is quite enough to enable her to
travel anywhere along the coast. She carries enough
coal to travel 5,000 miles at 12 knots an hour. This
would take her about 700 miles at full speed. She
could probably turn a complete circle of a radius of
twice her length in between two and three minutes.
She can carry 100 or even a much greater number of
torpedoes with her when going on a cruise. To show
how she compares with the best of the latest English
built torpedo boats, it may be said that the Destructor,
built for the Spanish Government, carries but ten torpedoes,
although she has five tubes to fire them from,
and this is the usual number carried. The range of the
best of these foreign torpedoes is 600 yards, under the
most favorable circumstances, and in a seaway not
more than 100 or 200 yards. The exploding charge is
75 pounds of gun-cotton, an explosive that is exceedingly
inefficient when compared with nitro-glycerine.</p>

<p>The new boat will also be armed with
the usual rapid-firing guns which are
placed on foreign torpedo boats. These
are to be used in battle with craft like
herself and small boats. It is expected
that she will be finished in six months.</p>

<h2 id="The_Strength_of_Snails">The Strength of Snails.</h2>

<p>Perceiving a common snail, <i>Helix aspersa</i>,
crawling up the window blind one
evening, it occurred to me to try what it
could draw up perpendicularly. Accordingly,
I attached to its shell four reels of
cotton, fastening one after the other until
I ascertained that a greater load would
exceed the limit of its strength. I then
weighed the entire load, and found that it weighed 2¼
ounces, while the snail weighed only ¼ ounce. Thus
it was able to lift perpendicularly nine times its weight.
I then made an experiment with a larger snail, weighing
one-third ounce, the load being composed chiefly
of the same material as the last, but so placed as to
be drawn in a horizontal position on the table. Reels
of cotton to the number of twelve were fastened to
it, with a pair of scissors, a screw driver, a key, and
a knife, weighing altogether seventeen ounces, or fifty
times the weight of the snail. The same snail when
placed on the ceiling was able to travel with a weight
of four ounces suspended from its shell. I next tried
it on a piece of common thread, suspended and hanging
loose with another snail of its own weight, which
it carried up the thread with apparent ease. After
this I tried it on a single horsehair strained in a horizontal
position, but it had then enough to do to crawl
over this narrow bridge without a load.&mdash;<i>E. Sandford,

If paper is blackened, its surface will reflect rays that
can act powerfully upon the sensitive plate in a camera,
even if the eye, by convention and association, would
determine it to be actually black. The same is to be
said of black silk and velvet. The latter, more than
any other substance, approaches real black. It is an object
of common observation that all colors show much
more strongly in velvet than in any other material.
The reason for this is that, owing to the depth of the
pile, the light undergoes multiple reflection. The percentage
of white light is diminished with each reflection,
and the colored rays become less and less contaminated
with those of other hues. The same reasoning
applies to black velvet. The light by multiple
reflection from its substance is more and more absorbed,
and the familiar intense black is the result. A
piece of this material, placed upon cloth or silk, always
appears, and is, the blacker. In choosing velvet for such
experiments, care must be taken not to use a blue
black. The dead black is the proper one to select.</p>

<p class="caption">CHEVREUL'S BLACK.</p>
</div>

<p>Black being the absence of color is producible by excluding
light. The production of the velvet black, we
have seen, depends on the mechanical texture of the
goods. Nothing is so black as a perfectly dark room.
Carrying out these principles, Chevreul devised the
wonderfully ingenious way of producing a true black
which we illustrate.</p>

<p>He lined the interior of a box with black. Pigment,
black silk, or black velvet may be used. In the cover
of the box he made a hole, not too large, but bearing
a certain ratio to the area of the cover. The size
should not exceed one-tenth this surface. The spot
thus produced reflected no light, as there was no surface.
The interior of the box, by color and shadow, was
prevented from reflecting any light, so that absolute
blackness resulted. The blackest velvet or silk placed
alongside of this spot appears lighter in color.</p>

<p>In constructing the apparatus illustrated, a famous
proverb was selected as a theme, in which a certain personage
is stated not to be so black as he is painted.
The author of "English as She is Spoke" renders this
proverb, "He not so devil as he is black." The blackness
of this image is absolute.</p>

<p>A pasteboard box is lined with black silk or velvet,
and any desired figure is cut through the cover. This
may then be painted as black as possible, or before the
figure is cut out, silk or velvet may be pasted over it,
and the figure cut through pasteboard and covering
together.</p>

<p>Then, on putting the cover in place, holding the box
so that a side light will fall upon it, thus preventing
direct access of light rays to the interior, the figure will
stand out strongly black against a background which,
but for the contrast, would itself be pronounced absolutely
black.</p>

<p>To apply the most rigorous test, a member of the
Society of Amateur Photographers of New York made a
photograph of such a box. A carbon B dry plate was
used, with thirty-five minutes' exposure, with stop f-30.
The result was a negative perfectly transparent where
the figure came, but strongly affected by the black box
cover. Part of the cover was coated with black silk
and part was painted, but both reflected light enough
to produce a full photograph upon the plate.</p>

<p>A most interesting application of this principle on
the large scale has been made of late years, especially
by E. J. Marey, in the photography of moving animals.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
With Chevreul's black as a screen, a plate can be exposed
unaffected by the background, and will reproduce
objects moving across the space with perfect fidelity.</p>

<h2 id="The_American_Exhibition_London">The American Exhibition, London.</h2>

<p>Recently we had an opportunity of going over
the grounds of the forthcoming American Exhibition
at Earls Court. The site is comprised in the triangle
between Earls Court, West Brompton, and West Kensington
stations, and is thus extremely well situated
for easy access from all parts of London. The area
that will be covered by the exhibition is about twenty-three
acres, eight of which are on one and fifteen on
the other side of the West London line, an iron bridge
over the railway connecting the two portions. Although
the work has been going on for some time,
little is as yet seen of any building, the operations
up to the present having been confined mostly to
earth works, leveling, and draining. The land to be
occupied by the exhibition might almost be called
virgin soil, and all the drains had to be put in by
the company. A good deal of soil has been moved,
and some artificial mounds of considerable extent have
been thrown up. In that portion of the exhibition
which will be illustrative of the "Wild West," a large
arena and a grand stand capable of seating 25,000 persons
are in course of construction. The feature of special
interest to engineers is, however, on the other side
of the grounds, where the main building for the reception
of the machinery and other exhibits is now being
erected. The main hall has a frontage of brickwork
240 feet long, but the rest will all be constructed of
iron and glass. The total length of this hall is 1,200
feet, and a special feature in its construction is the employment
of old steel rails for the columns, purlins,
and rafters, on a plan devised by Mr. H. G. Wynne,
the engineer to the company. The whole of the framework
is thus made out of old rails, the only portions
specially made for the purpose being the cast iron
sockets for the columns, cast steel shoes for the connections
between purlins, rafters, and columns, and
tie bars, which are made of ordinary round iron.
There will be six bays of 30 feet each, and one bay of
60 feet. The columns are formed by two rails, riveted
together with their flanges, so as to present a
cross in transverse section. These are placed into cast
iron sockets, which are set upon cement piers sunk in
the ground. The outermost columns for the first and
last spans are provided with struts, also formed out of
rails, fixed to a sleeper, connecting the bottom of the
strut with the foot of the column, this
provision being made to provide against
lateral strains; but the columns of the
intermediate spans have no struts. The
rafters are also made of rails, placed with
the flanges uppermost, those for the short
spans being in one length, but those for
the long spans being fastened together
by fish plates. The usual length of rail
employed for the columns is 18 feet and
24 feet. There is a fall in the ground of
about 2 feet to both sides from the middle
of the building. To avoid the necessity
of employing columns of different lengths,
the ridge of the roof is carried parallel to
the ground, and will therefore also show
a fall of 2 feet on each side of the middle.
This will be hidden by a loose louver,
which is placed all along the ridge, so that the outline
of the roof will appear straight and horizontal. The
sides of the building will be of galvanized corrugated
iron.&mdash;<i>Industries</i>.</p>

<p class="hang big"><span class="smcap">Mineral Resources of the United
States, Calendar Year</span> 1885.
Washington: Government Printing
Office, 1886. Pp. 576.</p>

<p>This is a carefully compiled volume, giving the statistics
for mineral products in the United States. Coal,
coke, petroleum, and natural gas are first treated of; the
metals, from iron to zirconium, come next. Under aluminum
the work of Col. Frishmuth, of Philadelphia,
and of the Cowles Smelting Company, of Cleveland, are
noted. In view of the demand for zirconium pencils for
the oxyhydrogen light, the section on the sources and
preparation of the oxide, by Mr. David T. Ray, is of
special interest. Other subjects treated are structural
materials, abrasive materials (buhr stones, etc.), precious
stones, fertilizers, glass materials, and, under
many other headings, a complete review of the titular
subject appears. We also note a section of much interest
on mineral paints, by Mr. Marcus Benjamin, F.C.S. In
it the preparation of barytes as an adulterant for paints
is described at some length. In some instances an
elaborate explanation of the classification of paints as
adopted is given. In other cases it is entirely omitted.
The first system is certainly preferable. A very full
index closes the work. It can be had on application to
the Director of the United States Geological Survey,
Washington, D. C., the cost of printing and binding
(40 cents) being at the same time remitted.</p>

<p class="lrg">(1) L. M. W. asks (1) a receipt for
marsh mallows, as made by confectioners. A. Dissolve
one-half pound of gum arabic in one pint of water,
strain and add one half pound of fine sugar, and place
over the fire, stirring constantly until the sirup is dissolved,
and all of the consistency of honey. Add gradually
the whites of four eggs well beaten. Stir the mixture
until it becomes somewhat thin and does not adhere
to the finger. Flavor to taste and pour into a tin
slightly dusted with powdered starch, and when cool
divide into small squares. 2. The title of a good veterinary
journal. A. <i>American Veterinary Review</i>, New
York. 3. The formula for a spavin cure? A. Take
of sweet oil 4 ounces, spirits of turpentine 2 ounces,
oil of stone 1 ounce. Mix and apply three times per
day. 4. A receipt for a wash that will prevent rabbits
from injuring the bark of fruit trees. A. We know of
nothing good for this purpose.</p>

<p class="lrg">(2) A. L. K. asks how common fat can
be rendered into tallow in an open kettle. A. Keep
the tallow melted for some time, along with about two
per cent of sulphuric acid largely diluted with water,
employing constant agitation, and allowing the whole
to cool slowly; then remelt the cake with a large quantity
of hot water, and wash well.</p>

<p class="lrg">(3) W. C. B. asks about the process and
kind of machinery used in preparing raw sienna for
paint. A. The raw sienna is thrown directly on the
hearth of a reverberatory furnace and kept thoroughly
raked until it assumes a proper color. Very little, if
any, sienna is known to be burnt in this country.</p>

<p class="lrg">(4) W. M. M. asks for some transparent
paint suitable to paint on tracing muslin. A. You must
use a transparent varnish such as the following: Dissolve
30 parts of copal and 2 parts of camphor in 120
parts of oil of turpentine and 30 parts of oil of lavender.
Use lakes, gamboge, Prussian blue, and the other transparent
colors, mixed with the vehicle.</p>

<p class="lrg">(5) S. S. asks a receipt for black heads.
A. Cover the parts afflicted with a pomade consisting
of kaolin 4 parts, glycerine 3 parts, acetic acid 2 parts,
with the addition of a small quantity of ethereal oil.
See <span class="smcap">Supplement</span>, No. 542.</p>

<p class="lrg">(6) W. L. asks (1) a cure for frost bitten
feet. A. For frost bites, rub the affected parts
with pure oil of peppermint. It will also prevent the
after effect of chilblains. Care should be taken to use
only the pure oil, and not the essence of peppermint,
as the essence will not have the desired effect. 2. How
plate glass is made. A. See <span class="smcap">Scientific American
Supplement</span>, No. 340.</p>

<p class="lrg">(7) A. T.&mdash;Hard rubber is a very good
insulator; gutta percha is also very good, and can be
softened by boiling water and given any desired shape.</p>

<p class="lrg">(8) J. H. S. wants a good receipt to prevent
hair coming out. A. Scald black tea, 2 ounces,
with 1 gallon of boiling water, strain, and add 3 ounces
glycerine, tincture cantharides ½ ounce, bay rum 1
quart. Mix well and perfume. This is a good preparation
for frequent use in its effect both on the scalp
and hair, but neither will be kept in good condition
without care and attention to general health. See articles
in <span class="smcap">Supplements</span>, 102, 388, 396.</p>

<p class="lrg">(9) A. H. asks the size of steel wire rope
necessary to suspend a weight of 16,000 pounds, each
end of the rope being fastened 1,600 yards apart, the
weight to travel from one end to the other on the rope.
A. The scheme of so long a span carrying a load is
impracticable. A span of 4,800 feet will nearly absorb
the margin of safety by its own weight, depending upon
the amount of deflection that could be allowed in the
catenary curve. The largest steel cables that are made,
2⅝ inches, weigh 13 pounds per foot, or over 31 net tons
for your span; with a deflection of one twenty-fifth, or
nearly 200 feet, the tension would be 3¼ times the
weight, or 254,800 pounds, while the ultimate strength
is but 400,000 pounds.</p>

<p class="lrg">(10) G. A. L. asks: Why will a brake on
the hind end of a train of cars hold more than a brake
set ahead of it on train? A. We do not know that it is
so. It is possibly a fancy.</p>

<p class="lrg">(11) A. K. H. asks: Will hot air cool
off by sending it rapidly through a wooden tube 300 or
400 feet long? If so, how much? A. Yes, slightly.
An iron pipe is better if you wish to cool the air. How
much the air will be cooled will depend on initial temperature
and the temperature of the conductor and
surrounding air.</p>

<p class="lrg">(12) H. H. writes: I have large quantities
of iron and steel to pickle, or, in other words, to
clean. I use oil of vitriol, which is expensive and dangerous.
Is there an acid that would be cheaper and
at the same time as effective? A. We know of nothing
cheaper or better than sulphuric acid for pickling
castings. The most economical method, as practiced
here, is found in the hot bath, a tub lined with lead, or
if of small requirement a stone pot. Water 5 to 8 parts,
acid 1 part. Boil the work in the acid bath for a few
minutes, then rinse in hot water. There is no danger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
if properly managed. For wrought iron and steel, use
hydrochloric acid and water.</p>

<p class="lrg">(13) W. F. E. asks: 1. How are bath
bricks made? A. Bath bricks are found native as
minerals, and are imported from England. 2. How are
papier mache ornaments moulded, and where can I procure
a work on the subject? A. We can send you Spons'
"Workshop Receipts" for $2.00, first series, which contains
full information on papier mache. See also various
articles in <span class="smcap">Scientific American Supplement</span>
on the technology of the paper trade.</p>

<p>(14) W. M. S. asks how to make liquid
glue. A. Take a wide mouthed bottle, and dissolve in
it 8 ounces best glue in ½ pint water, by setting it in a
vessel of water, and heating until dissolved. Then add
slowly 2½ ounces strong nitric acid 36° Baume, stirring
all the while. Effervescence takes place, with generation
of fumes. When all the acid has been added, the
liquid is allowed to cool. Keep it well corked, and it
will be ready for use at any time.</p>

<p class="lrg">(15) E. H. F. asks what preparation
steam laundries use to make their goods so stiff and have
such a fine gloss, and how is it used, and, if used with
starch, is hot or cold starch used? A. Melt 2½ pounds
of the very best A 1 paraffine wax over a slow fire.
When liquefied, remove from the fire and stir in 100
drops oil of citronella. Have a lot of round new pie
tins, clean and nice; place them on a level table, coat
them slightly with sweet oil, and pour about six tablespoonfuls
of the enamel into each tin. The pan may
be floated in water to cool the contents sufficiently to
permit the mixture to be cut or stamped out with a
tin cutter into small cakes about the size of a peppermint
lozenge. Two of these cakes added to each pint
of starch will cause the smoothing iron to impart the
finest possible finish to muslin or linen, besides perfuming
the clothes.</p>

<p class="lrg">(16) J. T. M., Jr., asks for a tempering
liquid for tempering a flat coiled spring, ⅛ of an inch
thick, 1½ inches wide, 20 feet long, without drawing the
temper. A. You can get a spring temper in the hardening
bath. Harden in water or oil and draw temper
in an iron pan of linseed oil at boiling temperature.</p>

<p class="lrg">(17) C. E. H. writes: I have nearly 1,000
feet of out-door steam pipe carried in elevated wooden
boxes. What is a good and cheap pipe covering to
prevent loss of heat? A. Pulverized charcoal or sawdust
makes a good cheap insulation for steam pipes.
The boxes should be large enough to allow 2 inches
clearance all around the pipe, the latter to be retained
in position by cleats. Boxes should be tight enough to
prevent circulation of air. Tar the outside to make
weather proof.</p>

<p class="lrg">(18) B. L. asks: 1. Is there any method
for removing rust stains from white cloth or linen?
A. See the table in <span class="smcap">Scientific American Supplement</span>
No. 158, for the "Removal of Stains and Grease Spots."
2. Is there any book showing how to work out chemical
problems, and giving answer in the back of the
book? A. Professor J. P. Cooke's "Chemical Problems
and Reactions" can be sent you postpaid for $1.</p>

<p class="lrg">(19) D. B. wants a receipt for a dark
cherry stain for a white pine floor. A. Use rain water
3 quarts, annatto 4 ounces; boil in a copper kettle till
the annatto is dissolved, then put in a piece of potash
the size of a walnut; keep it on the fire about half an
hour longer, and it is ready to bottle for use.</p>

<p class="lrg">(20) J. T. S.&mdash;Engines with automatic
cut-offs will run steady with variable work. If you
have a governor that only controls a throttle valve, there
will be a small variation of speed with as much variation
in the work as you state. Much depends upon
the relative amount of work absorbed by the mill and
the variable machinery.</p>

<h2>Patents in Brazil and Mexico.</h2>

<p>Until quite recently, considerable difficulty
has been experienced by inventors
in obtaining patents in both Brazil and
Mexico. The requirements of the officials
of these countries caused much bother
and delay, and the expenses of a patent
corresponded therewith.</p>

<p>But there no longer exists that trouble
and delay in obtaining patents in either
country. The proprietors of this paper
have perfected arrangements with resident
professional gentlemen in both
countries, Brazil and Mexico, which enables
them to obtain patents within
reasonable time and at reasonable cost.</p>

<p>These two countries embrace an enormous
area of territory, and makers of improved
machinery and implements are
now finding a market for their products
in those countries.</p>

<p>The cost need no longer deter inventors
from obtaining patents in either Brazil
or Mexico.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN PATENTS.<br />

<small>Their Cost Reduced.</small></h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The expenses attending the procuring of patents in
most foreign countries having been considerably reduced
the obstacle of cost is no longer in the way of a
large proportion of our Inventors patenting their inventions
abroad</p>

<p><b>CANADA.</b>&mdash;The cost of a patent in Canada is even
less than the cost of a United States patent, and the
former includes the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, British Columbia, and Manitoba.</p>

<p>The number of our patentees who avail themselves of
the cheap and easy method now offered for obtaining
patents in Canada is very large, and is steadily increasing.</p>

<p><b>ENGLAND.</b>&mdash;The new English law, which went into
force on Jan. 1st. 1885, enables parties to secure patents
in Great Britain on very moderate terms. A British patent
includes England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and the
Channel Islands. Great Britain is the acknowledged
financial and commercial center of the world, and her
goods are sent to every quarter of the globe. A good
invention is likely to realize as much for the patentee
in England as his United States patent produces for
him at home, and the small cost now renders it possible
for almost every patentee in this country to secure a patent
in Great Britain, where his rights are as well projected
as in the United States.</p>

<p><b>OTHER COUNTRIES.</b>&mdash;Patents are also obtained
on very reasonable terms in France, Belgium, Germany,
Austria, Russia, Italy, Spain (the latter includes Cuba
and all the other Spanish Colonies), Brazil, British India,
Australia, and the other British Colonies.</p>

<p>An experience of <b>FORTY</b> years has enabled the
publishers of <span class="smcap">The Scientific American</span> to establish
competent and trustworthy agencies in all the principal
foreign countries, and it has always been their aim to
have the business of their clients promptly and properly
done and their interests faithfully guarded.</p>

<p>A pamphlet containing a synopsis of the patent laws
of all countries, including the cost for each, and other
information useful to persons contemplating the procuring
of patents abroad, may be had on application to
this office.</p>

<p><b>MUNN &amp; CO.,</b> Editors and Proprietors of <span class="smcap">The Scientific
American</span>, cordially invite all persons desiring
any information relative to patents, or the registry of
trade-marks, in this country or abroad, to call at their
offices, 361 Broadway. Examination of inventions, consultation,
and advice free. Inquiries by mail promptly
answered.</p>
